    <h2 id="quite-dated-and-pretty-boring-410">Quite dated and pretty boring 4/10</h2>

<p><em>The Oregon Trail</em> is a travel log written from the perspective of an Easterner the mid-1800s attempting to explore the old west by traveling the Oregon Trail. During this adventure the writer documents his interactions with Native Americans, Mexicans and Frenchmen in the area. The book portrays the world from a bigoted viewpoint which was probably the norm at the time was written but is now quite shocking.</p>

<p>Throughout the book the speaker is generally not likable from a modern perspective. The speaker is bigoted, self important and poorly prepared. He spends a good amount of time discussing his amusement at the local population and their “savagery”. While It is important to remember and understand historical viewpoints that have shaped our history, the book has neither the valuable first hand accounts or literary quality to warrant a read coming off mostly as the musings of a bigoted man ill prepared for the world while judging and degrading those who helped him survive.</p>

    <h2 id="not-the-strongest-propaganda-piece---510">Not the Strongest Propaganda Piece - 5/10</h2>

<p><em>The Communist Manifesto</em> is a very famous and influential document that was recommended to me to read not as a political piece but as an example of persuasive writing. I was sourly disappointed with the literary quality of it as a persuasive piece. Perhaps the target market was very different when the pamphlet was produced but I felt that the arguments produced were disjointed and lacked the focus to really push a reader towards the writers opinions.</p>

    <h2 id="an-interesting-and-easy-read-that-while-slanted-is-great---810">An interesting and easy read that while slanted is great - 8/10</h2>

<p><em>Empire of the Summer Moon</em> is definitely a history book written with to fit the authors narrative. The book describes the late history of the Comanche people and there nineteenth century conflicts with the US government. The book is very interesting, the stories and history is exciting and well written in an approachable way creating an easy read regardless of your interest in the actual subject matter.</p>

<p>The reason I am giving the book a 8/10 is because it does appear to trying to sell a very specific narrative. The books seems to take the view of particular characters being great heros of the west and seems to try to really force those ideas. Not only does the book build up the heros but it also portrays and emphasizes the flaws in the characters around them. While I enjoyed the book I was expecting it to take a more academic view of history and focus more on facts less on selling a viewpoint.</p>

    <h2 id="a-book-which-while-not-riveting-does-walk-through-a-good-amount-of-history---610">A book which while not riveting does walk through a good amount of history - 6/10</h2>

<p><em>China A History</em> walks through the long recorded history of China. It throughout the book it attempts to highlight important events both in relationship to the world at the time in the current geopolitical environment. I feel as though I learned a good amount more about Chinese history and the various dynasties. Due to its length, the book didn’t attempt to go into any great detail and really did a great job of focusing on the ways in which the events resonate and drive the environment today.</p>

<p>From an intellectual standpoint the book was excellent, it was plainly written and  <em>very</em> boring through. Clearly it was written as a academic exorcise and not meant for general consumption. It was pretty hard to get through and despite being only 500 pages felt like it took an eternity to get through. I would only recommend this to someone which a very strong interest in Chinese history as it certainly isn’t for the weak of spirit.</p>

    <h2 id="somewhat-dry-book-focusing-too-much-on-legends-instead-of-history-5510">Somewhat dry book focusing too much on legends instead of history 5.5/10</h2>

<p><em>Tibet A History</em> outlines the history of the Tibetan people, Tibet and the Tibetan Buddhism from the 700s till today. The book was frankly boring. While the book was at least brief, most of the history is presented with little elaboration or detail and much of the book seems to function like an annotated timeline merely listing events as they occur. This is quite annoying especially in early history when it lists out the effects of magic and mythical battles. The book does become slightly more detailed and more engaging as it moves into the twentieth century and I wouldn’t say the book is bad exactly just not very entertaining.</p>

<p>While I haven’t read much on the subject matter, I assume there has to be a much better book covering similar topics in a much better way. I would still recommend reading the book if you are interested in the subject matter and can pick it up easily/ for free but I certainly would not seek it out.</p>

    <h2 id="a-somewhat-generic-introduction-to-okrs---6510">A somewhat generic introduction to OKRs - 6.5/10</h2>

<p>The book outlines an example of a startup utilizing OKRs then dives into strategies to implement them in the real work. Overall, the book is very brief which is botha blessing and a curse. While the book required very little time to read it also provided very little information about the implementation and setup of OKRs in an organization. Many topics such as exploratory OKRs and reevaluating goals were briefly touched on but the title provides no real insights into their implementation of or the various implications they could have. Overall, the book is an easy read which provides a decent introduction to the concept of OKRs while lacking the meat to provide a reader with the necessary knowledge to actually implement them.</p>

    <h2 id="a-great-and-interesting-read-which-rivals-but-doesnt-quite-match-the-fortunes-of-africa-810">A great and interesting read which rivals but doesn’t quite match The Fortunes of Africa 8/10</h2>

<p><em>The Fate of Africa -  A History of the Continent Since Independence</em> comes from the same author as <em>The Fortunes of Africa - A 5000-Year History of Wealth, Greed, and Endeavor _ and similarly tries to outline the general flow of history across the diverse and independent regions of Africa while respecting that it is a definitive guide on no particular items. _The Fate of Africa</em> focuses in on the history of Africa since the beginning of decolonization after WWII. The book does a great job of attempting to briefly summarize significant events and how they fit together an within the entire geopolitical trends of the time.</p>

<p>Coming from the same author as <em>Fortunes</em>, Martin Meredith, I had high expectations for the novel and I was not disappointed. The book imbraced the limitation of being a single 700 page volume and treated the subject matter with respect attempting not to focus to much on particularities but rather provide the user with ideas for independent research. I do think book was less of a page turner then <em>Fortunes</em> but would still highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest but not a strong background in the recent history of Africa or the Cold War in general.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>A general sci-fi novel kicking off the <em>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em> trilogy, it follows several physicists related to a conspiracy revolving around extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2 id="my-impressions">My Impressions</h2>

<p>I found the story and the conspiracy to be a novel and interesting concept and I feel like the book did a great job of setting up the trilogy but the book wasn’t really a page turner. While the book was certainly readable and entertaining the book doesn’t really stand on its own. I will probably read the subsequent books in the series but the first book definitely was not meant to be an entire story and I would only recommend the book if you are prepared to read the subsequent books. Additionally, some of the prose quality was lost in translation. While the translation was well done some of the flow was a somewhat “chunky”, rough and doesn’t necessarily translate very well but I translator does address that this was intentional at the end of the book.</p>

    <h2 id="an-excellent-book-everyone-should-read---910">An excellent book everyone should read. - 9/10</h2>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The book follows the lives of a family intertwined in the drug trade in the Franklin Square neighborhood of Baltimore.</p>

<h2 id="my-impressions">My Impressions</h2>

<p>This is an excellent book which I would recommend for everyone. The book is written as a novel but based on journalist interviews over the course of a year. This creates a intriguing and compelling narrative while still allowing following real life events. I really likes this general format, it actually reminded me a lot of <em>Beautiful Swimmers</em> in that way and I definitely need to explore more books written in a similar format.</p>

<p>The material of the book provides a realistic view into the world of addiction and the deeply systemized issues associated with it. The book should be mandatory reading for anyone who lacks empathy or is overly trusting of others trapped in the spiral of addiction.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The book goes through ways to spend less and invest saving for the future and the near future.</p>

<h2 id="my-impressions">My Impressions</h2>

<p>This book is extremely basic, basically it says to spend less and put money into a diversified stock portfolio. I don’t think I really got anything out of the book in terms of usable information but I really wasn’t expecting to. The book was a very quick and easy read and was moderately entertaining throughout so I wouldn’t describe it as a bad book just really basic. I would recommend this book maybe to teenagers or younger people when they get there first job, I think it does do a great job of emphasizing the importance of compounding interest and investing early.</p>
