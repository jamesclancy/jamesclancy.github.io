Need to scope out and set up the initial pages for the first stage of the project. I will also set up the routing to these pages.

Initially at least, the site is going to be a SPA and not play nicely with SEO. This is largely fine as the project isn't truly a production site meant for general consumption.

## Goals of this Step
* Scope a list of pages
* Create Elmish routes to said pages

## Results

### List of pages
* Home
* Find
* Browse
* AddLocation
* YourLocations
* Login
* Register
* Logout
* YourAccount
* EditLocation
* ViewLocation
* About

### Implementation Details & Notes
