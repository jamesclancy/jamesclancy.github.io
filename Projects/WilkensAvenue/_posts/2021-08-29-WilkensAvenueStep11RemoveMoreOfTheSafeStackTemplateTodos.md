## Goals of this Step
* Remove the ToDo references throughout the project. 

## Process

When I generated the template application it included a good amount of boilerplate stuff which references a generic `ToDo` application that was included in the template. I initially left most of these their but it has grown annoying to work with. I would like to remove as many references to them as I can find throughout the project to help clean it up. I wanted this to be a different step so it it wouldn't muddy up any additional PR diffs. 

## Results
