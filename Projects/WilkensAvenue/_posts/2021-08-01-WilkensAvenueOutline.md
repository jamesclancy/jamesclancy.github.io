## Introduction & Overview

I am going to iterate off some of my learnings from the SafeCardGame and try to make a simple site for documenting and reading about the industrial history of Southwest Baltimore.
Heavily tied with the B&O Railroad, Southwest Baltimore served as the Eastern endpoint from which the earliest trains crossed the Appalachia and went west.
Because of this many historically significant building and places exist throughout Southwest, unfortunately many of these places are in rough states of disuse and in danger of being forgotten.
Wilkens Avenue is a major road through Southwest Baltimore which once (and to a certain extent still does) host a large amount of industrial history.

My goals in the project are to:
* Learn more about Baltimore's industrial past, which I unfortunately don't know much about but find very interesting.
* Continue to experiment and iterate on past learnings about the SAFEStack
* Get a little more experience working with GIS data
* I would like to learn more about the F#/JS interop, I think this project may give me the opportunity to wrap an existing JS/Typescript library for use with Fable.

I am going to be doing this a little differently from how I did the SafeCardGame but will similarly be starting with the `SAFE` template from the Safe Stack and host on Heroku.
