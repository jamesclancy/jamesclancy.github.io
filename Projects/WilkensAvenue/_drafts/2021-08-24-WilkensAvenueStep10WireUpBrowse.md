## Goals of this Step
* Browse Page vie model includes all data to render the page
* Browse page receives model from update and inturn api and renders the page

## Process

For now I am going to move on from the tags input issue and come back to it later. I think I have identified some possible solutions but I think I am using to new a version of webpack to utilize them. 


## Results

Currently, the page can be viewed [here](https://wilkens-avenue.herokuapp.com/#/browse/12312).
