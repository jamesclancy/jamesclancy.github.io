<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The book discusses the evolution of how people view geometry and the world around them in general from ancient greeks discovering axiomatic thought to modern string theory. The book largely focuses on the history but does give general overviews of the technological developments.</p>

<h2 id="my-impressions">My Impressions</h2>

<p>This book only briefly touches on technical subjects and largely focuses on the history. In telling the history there are some comical moments but general is quite bland. Interest could have been generated by more thoroughly digging into the technical side or focusing more on page turning amusing prose. Unfortunately, the book left me feeling it was just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meh</code>. It was readable but not a page turner, this really disappointed me as the subject matter is so interesting.</p>

    <h2 id="interesting-view-on-culture-clashes-and-the-medical-system---710">Interesting view on culture clashes and the medical system - 7/10</h2>

<p><em>The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down</em> is an true story telling the story of a family of refugees coming to America and having a variety of encounters with the American Medical System. The book paints a picture of family trying to do the best they can as best they know it and the troubled attempts of the medical sy8stem to reach and help the family.</p>

<p>The book doesn’t portray the family or the doctors working with them in a bad light but rather highlights the inability of the system they exist in to best facilitate communication and the successful distribution of healthcare where it is needed.</p>

<p>I liked that the book didn’t focus on blaming people but rather highlighted how everyone was doing the best they could in the systems they existed in and the systems let everyone down. While not a particularly exciting I think the book is an excellent tale to emphasis the importance of empathy and trying to meet people where they are.</p>

    <h2 id="boring-string-of-brief-histories-510">Boring string of brief histories 5/10</h2>

<p><em>The Arabs - A History</em> by Eugene Rogan was similar in goal but significantly worse executed than _The Fortunes of Africa - A 5000-Year History of Wealth, Greed, and Endeavor _. The Book didn’t go in to much detail which makes a good amount of sense due to the breadth it was trying to cover but didn’t really dive into anything deep enough to inspire further research or interest. The book started during the ottoman rule of the Middle East and Northern Africa and quickly transitioned into a discussion of recent European interests in the region and onto the current political system.</p>

<p>Perhaps <em>The Fortunes of Africa</em> was just such an outstanding book that it makes this one seems unfairly bad but I cannot help but think I learned more and gained more knowledge about the Middle East region reading that book then this focused book. I would not recommend bothering to read this and perhaps looking for a different book on the topic.</p>

<p>_The Fortunes of Africa - A 5000-Year History of Wealth, Greed, and Endeavor _ really didn’t go into to many details but I think it worked in this format. The book gave an overview of five thousand years of history across an entire continent so it necessarily  didn’t go into great detail. Rather then thinking of this book as a “history” book I think of this book as a “Cliff Notes” on topics and an invitation for further research. I felt the book was inviting, expected little previous knowledge and well paced.</p>

<p>I would recommend this to someone who has a broad interest in world history but is looking for new topics to really dive into. I would not recommend this book to those who already possesses great knowledge of the African history or are looking to learning about any particular time period or region as this is not a detailed history.</p>

    <h2 id="interesting-topic-and-interesting-book-that-unfortunately-does-go-into-enough-detail-710">Interesting topic and interesting book that unfortunately does go into enough detail. 7/10</h2>

<p><em>The Balkans</em> was a long but entertaining read. The history of the Balkan peninsula was fascinating and I am surprised by how many blind spots I had to the history of the Austria-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires after my general American education.</p>

<p>I think the book did its best to focus on large events that impacted the west while still providing enough local history to set the settings and attempt to give the events some sort of context. Unfortunately, I feel that the authored erred to far on the side of conciseness and didn’t provide sufficient detail to give context of the intricacies of more recent Balkan events. Generally, it seemed like Albania, Slovenia, Bulgaria etc where left as almost a side note throughout much of the histories described and far to much focus was directed at the economic burdens caused by the Greek financial crisis and not the benefits, advantages and changes taking place across the Balkans as countries become more and more integrated with the European Union and the Western markets.</p>

<p>This book was interesting but it definitely left me unsatisfied and with a desire to read and learn more about the historical context of event in the Balkans.</p>

    <h2 id="book-still-holds-up-as-a-great-read-810">Book still holds up as a great read 8/10</h2>

<p><em>The Invisible Man</em> is another classic book I recently picked up for free. Unlike <em>Frankenstein</em> this book was still interesting and worth a read despite age. The story telling was interesting and the plot engaging. While the book does contain some dated concepts the book remains a readable tale told from an interesting perspective. The played up English accents in this book were still readable while adding to the atmosphere of the setting.</p>

<p>HG Wells does an excellent job of describing a detestable yet understandable character in the invisible man. As opposed to the lovable villain the book features an understandable jerk who backs himself into a bad situation, I feel like this creates an interesting narrative I don’t often see.</p>

<p>I would recommend this book for anyone who like Science Fiction or classical literature.</p>

<p>As another free <em>Young Jedi Knights</em> book I found I read this after finishing <em>Shards of Alderaan</em>. This was definitely weaker than <em>Shard of Alderaan</em> but still a very readable book and a very easy read at that. This book focused much more on combat but seemed to sort fo glance over any sort fo details or violence. This makes sense as it seems to be geared towards a younger audience it did make the book significantly less interesting. The book only took a few hours to read though so I would still recommend the investment to any fans of the <em>Nee Jedi Order</em> series.</p>

<p>I thought maybe I had read these as a kid but after starting to read some of the <em>Young Jedi Knights</em> books I don’t think I read these as a kid. Overall the book was simple and a really fast read. The book is clearly for kids which definitely shows in teh language, topics and writing style but the book was extremely quick to read.</p>

<p>Previous Kevin Anderson Start Wars books I have read have been less than stellar so wasn’t expecting much but this book was pretty solid. I would recommend this book to anyone who read and enjoyed the New Jedi Order. While this book isn’t exactly great literature it does provide some valuable insights into the back stories of the <em>NJO</em> characters.</p>

    <h2 id="boring-and-not-worth-reading---510">Boring and not worth reading - 5/10</h2>

<p>I picked up a free copy of Frankenstein recently as it is supposed to be a classic piece of literature and I have not read it (that I can remember). The book, while well and decoratively written, was quite boring. The frame story model might have been novel when the book was first written but today is quite common and didn’t really add much to the novel. The main thing going for the book was its short length but the way the characters droned on about topics I have no interest or investment in caused mer to rate this book a five out of ten.</p>

<p>This is a book to only read if assigned in school or in some other way required.</p>

    <h2 id="better-then-the-film-but-the-films-are-still-the-worst-part-of-the-star-wars-universe---610">Better then the film but the films are still the worst part of the Star Wars Universe - 6/10</h2>

<p>I grew up with Star Wars books and video games. As a child, <em>Star Wars</em> was never about the films but rather was <em>X-Wing vs Tie-Fighter</em> and the <em>Hand of Thrawn</em> trilogy. While I have seen the films they have always be secondary artifacts in the Star Wars Universe.</p>

<p>I believe I read some of the prequel books when I was a kid but haven’t read the novelizations of the original films, I recently saw <em>The Return of the Jedi</em> for free and decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>Overall, the book is okay but being based on the movie doesn’t have that much happening or that much character development. The book is relatively short (~180pg mass market paper back) and an easy read. The plot, the narrative and character development matched the film and doesn’t really compare to the literary world and narrative building found in <em>Stackpole</em> and <em>Zahn</em> Star Wars EU books.</p>

<p>This book might be worth while to read if you find it for free and are a big Start Wars fan but I definitely wouldn’t recommend paying for it. The book is quite meh and reminiscent of many mediocre franchise exploiting video games and books that come out after every major film is released.</p>
