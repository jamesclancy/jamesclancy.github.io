    <h2 id="cool-cover-weak-book---5510">Cool cover. Weak book. - 5.5/10</h2>

<p><em>The Penguin History of Latin America</em> attempts to detail the history of South and Central America from the times of Columbus till today. Unfortunately, this book falls in the familiar pattern of attempting to cover to much and degrading into a series of brief summaries of time periods listed after each other. While the book does cover many things, it never draws the reader in with much interesting content and lacks in any sort of cohesion to ties the historical events together.</p>

<p>The book would probably be alright for someone wanted a brief refresher on the history for someone already familiar but not a great general interest piece.</p>

<h2 id="my-impressions">My Impressions</h2>

<p>This title continued the series’ interesting philosophical discord but framed it a way which made it more directly related to our current world. Unlike the previous books, this title honed in on the most important characters an delivered a page turning, exciting book.</p>

<p>I feel that <em>Death’s End</em> is a good enough book to justify reading the other books in the trilogy and I would recommend anyone read the the series.</p>

<p>The follow up to <em>The Three Body Problem</em> and the second book in the the <em>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em> trilogy, it follows the events on Earth as copes with the knowledge of incoming hostile aliens and attempts to prepare itself.</p>

<h2 id="my-impressions">My Impressions</h2>

<p>I found the ideas of how Earth would cope in such a situation insightful and intriguing. The book holds a powerful mirror up to society, humanity and potentially life in general. Unfortunately I didn’t think the book was very exciting or much of an interesting read. I felt many of stories to be overly long and more detailed then needed without enough excitement or development to make it particularly engaging.</p>

<p>Overall, I find it a valuable study on human psychology but not a great piece of science fiction.</p>

    <h2 id="moderately-interesting-but-not-all-that-informative-510">Moderately interesting but not all that informative 5/10</h2>

<p><em>The Boxer Rebellion</em> tells the story of foreigners and christian converts trapped in the Beijing (Peking) Legations and cathedrals as they waited to be saved from the populist “boxers”.</p>

<p>Over all the book attempted to give a more human look and perspective to those trapped under the blockade and make the story more human and relatable. Overall though I found the book to provide little information or history that I did not learn in high school history class. The Boxer Rebellion was a very significant historical event as it marked beginning of the end of imperial china and colonialism in china but this books did little to explore the implications, meanings, motivations or effects of the rebellion. Instead of focusing on significant impacts or novel facts the book largely seemed to focus on how the people eat horses and rationed rice which while interesting to hear is not all that significant.</p>

    <h2 id="a-little-slow-but-still-worth-a-read-710">A little slow but still worth a read 7/10</h2>

<p><em>The Earth Is Weeping</em> details the various military conflicts between the American Army and various Native American Groups on the plains after the Civil War. The book is significantly more focused on military battles then other books I have read on the subject matter like <em>Dreams od El Dorado</em> or <em>Empire of the Summer Moon</em>. The military focus of the book does lead it to be a bit drier and less exciting then other books but the book does present a good amount of the information and was clearly well researched and well written.</p>

<p>Overall, I would have liked more personality and a more human perspective to be included in the book to make it a little more interesting but the book was certainly informative and perfectly readable for anyone with any sort of interest in the old west.</p>

        The Remaining A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) Books by George R.R. Martin

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 May 2022</span>

    <h2 id="very-disappointing-too-long-too-many-character-and-too-little-happening-310">Very disappointing, too long, too many character and too little happening 3/10</h2>

<p><em>A Game of Thrones</em> started the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> books on a decent foot. It set up a universe full of dramatic events which presented a lot of potential as a potential canvas for exciting stories to told on. The remaining 4 published books in the series (<em>A Clash of Kings</em>, <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, <em>A Feast for Crows</em>, <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>) were all long and boring. The shear number of characters introduced continued to increase as the books progressed with all the characters being largely forgettable and mostly interchangeable. The conflicts became more and more prevalent and petty as the book progressed. Not only did the the events have a lower bar of significance but their effects were more localize and effecting smaller and smaller sliver of the ever growing poor unrelatable characters.</p>

<p>The low point of the novels was the end of the fourth book <em>A Feast for Crows</em> where the author breaks the third wall to explain that stories for half the characters were absent because they were in <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>. To me the authors need to break the third wall helps to further highlight the fact these could have been a single 400 page book instead of four thousand page novels.</p>

    <h2 id="could-be-the-start-of-an-interesting-series-but-not-great-by-itself-7510">Could be the start of an interesting series but not great by itself 7.5/10</h2>

<p><em>A Game of Thrones</em> sets up a fantasy world set in the middle ages setting of knights, dragons and other fantasy cliches. I have heard a lot about the TV show so I figured I would give teh books a read. The first novel follows a cast of characters as they navigate palace intrigue eventually leading the death of a King and sets up an environment for more novel to explore teh kings succession.</p>

<p>As with many fantasy books the novel was written in an overly flowery style which made it needlessly long and stretched out. Overall teh book was okay but definitely not a complete story. While the book wasn’t exactly gripping it did hold my interest and I will continue to read the other books. Generally, this was really just an introduction to this fantasy universe and not a book which could stand on its own two feet. Only reading the subsequent books will tell if the time investment in reading this was worthwhile.</p>

    <h2 id="mediocre-at-best-510">Mediocre at best 5/10</h2>

<p><em>The Other Side of Paradise</em> is a group of stories written based on the authors time as a Tourist in Cuba. The book follows several characters as they try to cope with growing up partially connected to the modern world in shut of Cuba.</p>

<p>The characters in teh book are largely boring and not particularly interesting. While the book is well written the other all story is quite bland and not very memorable.</p>

    <h2 id="alright-but-not-great-710">Alright but not great 7/10</h2>

<p><em>The Andromeda Strain</em> is a novel about a government program to research extraterrestrial life. This research brings a dangerous disease to the Earth and a team of government scientists have to work quickly to fine a way to treat or contain the disease.</p>

<p>I found this book to be much weaker than <em>Congo</em> or <em>Jurassic Park</em>. The story was moderately engaging and entertaining but not a page turner. While teh book starts out exciting the story and storytelling slowly unravels into sort of a mess. By the end, the conclusion of the book was murky and not very satisfying. The book was fine but not really worth seeking out.</p>

    <h2 id="short-and-focused-and-moderately-informative-7510">Short and focused and moderately informative 7.5/10</h2>

<p><em>The Laws of Simplicity</em> outlines a number of “laws” for creating elegant solutions which seem simple. The book features 10 laws which generally lead to the final law which is remove the obvious and add meaning. I found the book a very simple read and relatively informative and. My overall impression after reading was that there is only one law of simplicity but I found going through a ll the various laws helpful to lead the reader to that conclusion.</p>

<p>The book only took a few hours to read and for that amount of time I think it was worthwhile but I probably would be annoyed if I actually spent money on the book and didn’t get it for free.</p>
