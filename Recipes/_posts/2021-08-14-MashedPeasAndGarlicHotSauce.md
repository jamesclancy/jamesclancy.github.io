Mashed Pea Spread with Garlic Hot Sauce

## Ingredients

- 1 can sweet peas (drained)
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons `Garlic` Medium peri-peri sauce
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds
- 1 tablespoon mustard
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder

## Yield

~ 4 serving (~ 4 sandwiches worth of spread)

## Process

1. Place all contents in a container
2. Mash it all together. It should turn into a red and green mash.
3. Place contents in container and chill until it thickens (over night).

## Results 

7/10 - This is very edible and a good way to get rid of can peas I stocked up with at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic/ lock-downs. The garlic hot sauce and mustard hides the pea flavor making a generic and `fine` food product. It was especially good topped with crunchy toping to hide some of the `mushy pea` texture.
