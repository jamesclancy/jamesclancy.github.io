Basic Pear Chutney made from harvested pears and random things I had in my kitchen.

## Ingredients

- 16 pounds of near-ripe and ripe pears (chopped up)
- 1.5 pounds of chopped walnuts
- 2.5 oz of cinnamon
- 0.5 gallons of apple-cider-vinegar
- 0.5 lb of raisins
- 1 tsp of onion powder

## Yield

~ 14 cups of chutney

## Process

Placed all the ingredients in a large pot and simmered until it formed a thick chutney consistency. This required stirring occasionally and took about an hour. 

## Results 

8/10 - the results are very good but extremely sweet. Because of the amounts of sugar and the amount of walnuts it seems to serve as a good peanut butter and jelly replacement spread more then a traditional chutney.
