3. After hte plantains seem cooked add all other ingredients and fill the remainder of the slow cooker with water
4. Leave on slow cook for 4 hours

## Results 

8/10 - This was alright, it makes for a good topping on like salads and such. Possibly would be better if less watery, maybe it would be better with steel cut oats or barley added?
