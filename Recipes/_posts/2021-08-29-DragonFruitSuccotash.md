Dragonfruit Succotash

## Ingredients

- 1 dragon fruit
- 1 can chickpeas drained
- 1 can no salt added sweet corn
- 1 diced plum tomato
- 3 diced green plums
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon mushroom extract

## Yield

~ 4 servings

## Process

1. Clean dragon fruit, cut in half. Using a spoon remove the meat in large chunks. Then dice the large chunks. Make sure to save all the juice that inevitably come out. 
2. Mix all the ingredients together
3. Chill in teh refrigerator until ready to serve

## Results 

8/10 - This is way better then normal triple succotash. This is surprisingly delicious and complementary while not being overly sweet. I ate some on a salad and it was one of the better `salad topping`. 

The reason I am giving this an 8 is the level of saltiness. This could probably be reduced by removing the mushroom extract and using fresh or sodium free canned chickpeas. I do think the mushroom extract is an important part contributor of umami in this dish. I am not certain how adding more tomatoes would play into the dish and I would think that would be the safest way to pump up the umami if the mushroom extract is removed.
