4. Boil water and stir into mixture

## Results 

9.5/10 - I make overnight oats everyday and this is probably the best combination I have come up with. The plantain adds a lot of depth to the texture/ flavor. It is good without the psyllium husk but the psyllium husk really pushes it over the top making it almost have a cake/ baked good texture.
