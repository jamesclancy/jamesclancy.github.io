<p><em>Practical Process Automation</em> outlines some strategies for orchestrating processes and practices for managing workflows across multiple systems. The book is free and is definitely sales material but does contain some interesting information. I enjoyed the discussion about orchestration vs choreography and the liked the explanations of commands vs events and there boundaries at the edges of bound contexts.</p>

<p>Overall it is a quick read and not bad to get more familiar with modeling sagas and workflows.</p>

<p><em>Congo</em> is a novel about a diamonds companies expedition to investigate a scouting team which went missing in the jungles of the Congo. The book features is the “techno-thriller” which is written like it was based on real events and is from the same author as Jurassic Park.</p>

<p>There was a film made based on this book and it was supposedly quite bad, it won a number of Golden Raspberry Awards. I decided to read the book despite the films reputation as I like <em>Jurassic Park</em>. I was pleasantly surprised by the book, it was a great, exciting story and while a little far fetched did seem to be well researched and a  good amount of effort spent to make it “realistic”.</p>

    <h2 id="informative-but-strongly-opinionated---7510">Informative but strongly opinionated - 7.5/10</h2>

<p><em>Collapse</em> walks through the events leading up to and contributing factors of various societies’ collapses from the Maya to Easter Island to the recent Rwandan genocide. It then compares those situations to modern situations in places like Montana, Australia and China. Similar to <em>Guns, Germs and Steel</em>, Diamond attempts to explain the political and scientific factors in an engaging and approachable way meant for all audiences.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading <em>Collapse</em> and while I feel as though I learned much throughout teh book I feel that some of its subject matter could be considered preachy and turn off some readers. I agree with much of what Jared said but definitely think some of the narrative discussed in relation to modern climate change could be outputting to many. I therefore only recommend the book for people with an interest in the general green movement, for those who are not interested or otherwise not convinced of climate change I do not think this book presents a comprehensive enough argument to change anyone’s opinion and strikes a tone that some may find offensive.</p>

    <h2 id="not-great-for-the-genre---410">Not great for the genre - 4/10</h2>

<p><em>The Armies of the Night</em> is one of the earliest works of “gonzo” journalism. The book follows the author’s participation in the March on the Pentagon protesting the Vietnam War. The title discusses the wide range of views in the 1960s US’s counterculture left and its growing disparities.</p>

<p>Largely, I found the book to be boring and the author to be quite pretensions. I believe that was possibly the point, as a way to highlight the disparities in the protest but I believe it made the book largely unreadable and quite difficult to get through. I would say this book is ver weak compared to the works of Wolfe or Thompson and do not recommend.</p>

<p><em>The Right Stuff</em> is an epic novel about the first American astronauts in the Mercury program. The book describes the personalities and general history surrounding the Mercury Seven and there wives.</p>

<p>While the novel does ver in the direction of gonzo journalism I felt this book was a nice half step from traditional journalism into the form of writing made famous by Hunter Thompson. I did enjoy the book and found it very engaging but I don’t think it delivered the excitement of books like <em>Hells Angels</em>. I think part of this because of teh subject matter but part is also the style. I would recommend this book to anyone but wouldn’t classify this as a must read.</p>

    <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2022</span>

    <h2 id="remarkably-information-while-horrifically-boring---410">Remarkably information while horrifically boring - 4/10</h2>

<p><em>Gideon’s Trumpet</em> details how one man’s court case reshaped the American legal system. Gideon, a small time gambler from Florida was convicted of burglary in a case where he could not afford legal representation. Because the case was in a state court and Florida at the time did not guarantee legal representation he was forced to represent himself and lost. He was eventually able to appeal the case to the Supreme Court in the case <em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em>. The Supreme Court ruled for Gideon and in turn guaranteed the right to representation in all criminal cases.</p>

<p>The book was quite informative and made me realize how little I knew about the workings of the American legal system. It also served to remind how astonishing boring and bureaucratic the legal system is and why I generally have not spent much time reading about it in the past. Maybe it is worthwhile to read this book if you are very interested in the legal system but I am assuming if you are already interested in the legal system you would get very little from the book.</p>

    <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2022</span>

    <h2 id="interesting-and-engaging-historical-narrative---710">Interesting and engaging historical narrative - 7/10</h2>

<p><em>Dead Wake</em> tells the true story of the British passenger vessel the Lusitania on its final journey and how its sinking brought the US into World War I. The book America’s desire to stay out of the fighting of WWI while profiting from the European’s demand for both weapons and necessary supplies. In an attempt to prevent supplies from reaching the United Kingdom German UBoats began targeting non-military shipping in a region around the UK. The Lusitania was a large passenger liner traveling from NYC to Liverpool which was thought to be impervious from German attack as it contained many American passengers. It was eventually sunk causing a public outcry and dragging the United States into the War.</p>

<p>I found <em>Dead Wake</em> to be compelling and interest holding as a book and informative as a historical source. I knew vaguely that U-Boats were introduced in WWI but generally associate them with WWII. I feel as though I learned a good amount the forces driving America into the “Great War” and provided me with some valuable historical perspective on a subject matter ofter overlooked in history class. I would recommend the book for individuals with an interest in American history.</p>

    <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2022</span>

    <h2 id="more-true-crime-than-popular-history-610">More true crime than popular history 6/10</h2>

<p><em>The Devil in the White City</em> follows two simultaneous story lines taking place in the late 1800s in Chicago. One story line follows the design and construction of the 1893 Columbian Exposition, the other follows a serial killer who is active in Chicago at the same time. The book mixes true crime with history to form a somewhat connected story that serves to portray the depravity of Chicago at the time. 
I was expecting a little more history and am not a large fan of the <em>true crime</em> genre but the book was certainly readable and relatively entertaining. I do think the composition of the multiple story lines did help to highlight the social issues of the time but I was honestly much more interested in the raising of the fair then the exploits of Holmes (the serial killer). I think this is good book if you are looking for true crime but probably not recommend it as a popular history.</p>

<p><em>Dreams of El Dorado</em> discusses the early history of the United States expanding westward from the Mississippi. The book discusses the acquisition of new territories, the journeys of settlers and the new lands’ eventual movement toward statehood.</p>

<p>Often non-fiction can be dry and while interesting not engaging. <em>Dreams of El Dorado</em> does an amazing job of creating an exciting narrative which flows fluidly through American history weaving together desperate and disjoint events into a compelling narrative that creates a novel level of “page-turn”-ability.</p>

<p>A must read for anyone with an interest in the history of the Old West.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2022</span>

    <h2 id="amazing-piece-of-literature-910">Amazing piece of literature 9/10</h2>

<p><em>Hell’s Angels</em> is a classic book by the famed reporter Hunter Thompson. The book recants stories of Hunter Thompson’s time spending a year with the motorcycle group Hells Angels. Hunter provides entertaining but likely largely exaggerated tales of fights parties and anti-social behavior he witnessed spending time with the group.</p>

<p>I had previously read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail. While these were both entertaining and engaging books I found Hell’s Angels even more compelling. I wouldn’t trust the book as an accurate historical account but I found the dynamic complexities of the sixties counter extremely interesting. I had never heard much about the interactions between the flower child counter culture and motorcycle group before and while I always knew they were counter culture groups from the same time period I never really thought of how they interacted.</p>

<p>I would recommend this book to anyone.</p>
