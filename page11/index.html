    <p>Similar to the SafeCardGame, I am going to utilize the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SAFE Template</code> to scaffold the initial site. This time though before making any code changes I am going to set up the Heroku setup and database configuration along with the appropriate configuration for test and scripts to publish. Previously, I delayed that and it was quite a pain point to do after the fact. Luckily, this time I am using a newer version of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SAFE</code> template which rolls with .NET 5 out of the box. In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SafeCardGame</code> project I manually upgraded that which turned out to be quite a pain.</p>

<h2 id="goals-of-this-step">Goals of this Step</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Create the project via the template</li>
  <li>Create the Repo on Github</li>
  <li>Create the setup for hosting</li>
  <li>Create the docker files etc for the container</li>
  <li>Have a script to build and push container to Heroku</li>
  <li>Add some basic database access via Dapper to the project, locally it should pull connection information from the App Secrets, when deployed it should use the Environmental Variables</li>
</ul>

    <h2 id="introduction--overview">Introduction &amp; Overview</h2>

<p>I am going to iterate off some of my learnings from the SafeCardGame and try to make a simple site for documenting and reading about the industrial history of Southwest Baltimore.
Heavily tied with the B&amp;O Railroad, Southwest Baltimore served as the Eastern endpoint from which the earliest trains crossed the Appalachia and went west.
Because of this many historically significant building and places exist throughout Southwest, unfortunately many of these places are in rough states of disuse and in danger of being forgotten.
Wilkens Avenue is a major road through Southwest Baltimore which once (and to a certain extent still does) host a large amount of industrial history.</p>

<p>My goals in the project are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn more about Baltimore’s industrial past, which I unfortunately don’t know much about but find very interesting.</li>
  <li>Continue to experiment and iterate on past learnings about the SAFEStack</li>
  <li>Get a little more experience working with GIS data</li>
  <li>I would like to learn more about the F#/JS interop, I think this project may give me the opportunity to wrap an existing JS/Typescript library for use with Fable.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am going to be doing this a little differently from how I did the SafeCardGame but will similarly be starting with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SAFE</code> template from the Safe Stack and host on Heroku.</p>

        SafeCardGame - Project Retrospective
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2021</span>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I came up with the idea that implementing a <em>Wingspan</em>-like combo-based card game using the safe stack. I thought this would be an interesting project as each card would have to have uniquely defined effects which would apply to the game state in a stack and provide me with a great opportunity to learn more about F# and the safe stack in general. Upon further thought I decided that a Wingspan-like game might be to complicated as a first real SafeStack project and decided to make a game sort of along the lines of Pokemon TCG or MTG which would be easier to iteratively test. Basically, this type of game would be more “playable” when it isn’t complete. I don’t think a game based on combos would be that playable without an extensive number of special effect card defined.</p>

<h2 id="process-and-reflection">Process and Reflection</h2>
<p>The process I went through is documented <a href="https://github.com/jamesclancy/SafeCardGame/blob/main/README.md">here</a>. Overall, I sort of lost interest and stopped working on it but it does pseudo-work. The end result is code base which I am not proud of but I did find the process of creating it relatively rewarding and I believe that it both exposed me to a number of new f# libraries while giving me some incites into what I should not do in future projects. One of the largest issues is how chatty the client-server, in teh initial development everything was running locally in the browser, using Elmish Bridge I then started piping these messages to the server. The fact that I could do this so easily was/is very cool but the end result leaves much to be desired. Additionally, I continuously faced stupid issues which could have been easily avoided if I had started writing unit tests at the beginning of the process. I sort of assumed this was going to be really simple and it wasn’t worth the time to really test the domain logic. That turned out to the incorrect.</p>

        Deviate by Beau Lotto

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2021</span>

    <h2 id="some-interesting-points-but-not-for-me---610">Some interesting points but not for me - 6/10</h2>

<p>Let me start by saying I generally don’t read books along the lines of <em>Deviate</em> by Beau Lotto. The book was available at my local Habitat for Humanity and appeared to be on an interesting topic so I picked it up.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The book discusses some of the ways in which people are constrained and limited both the preconceptions and memories of the culture in which they live and there own desire for certainty. Individuals need to understand these constraints in order to be adapt and come up with new <em>deviating</em> ideas which improve and invigorate society. The book lays out five principles for driving innovations which boil down to. It goes on to discuss how play is one of developing these new ideas and science, as a more directed version of play, is fundamental to developing new ideas at scale.</p>

<h2 id="my-impressions">My Impressions</h2>

<p>I found the subject mater interesting and found the discusses about play and science being the key to driving innovation interesting. Unfortunately, I didn’t find teh book all that rewarding or interesting. Largely I was reading teh book just to finish it not to find out what was going to be said next for that I am rating it a six out of ten. It might be a good book if you like this sort of pop-science books but it was definitely not for me.</p>

        Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy - Books 1-4
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Jul 2021</span>

    <h2 id="7510-as-an-adult-1010-as-a-child">7.5/10 as an adult, 10/10 as a child</h2>

<p>As a child, I really like Hitchhikers Guid to the Galaxy. I recently reread the first four books and found them not living up to my past expectations. The books are humorous but much of the books stems from the absurdity of the situations, this is alright in first book but as the books progress the levels of absurdity appear to be cranked up further and further until you reach <em>So Long and Thanks for All the Fish</em> which was a little painful to read.</p>

<p>I will note, I read all these books back to back (I had a collection of all four in one volume). It is very possible the my growing tied of the style of humor caused my distaste for the later books so perhaps the books are great with a break/rest taken between reads.</p>

<p>Generally, I would recommend reading the first book, especially if one liked it as a child, but would definitely not recommend reading the entire <em>Complete</em> Hitchhikers Guide in one go.</p>

    <h2 id="an-interesting-but-seemingly-skewed-view-of-history---710">An interesting but seemingly skewed view of history - 7/10</h2>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The book details the history of the “Central Eurasian” cultures throughout history. Instead of following any one particular group of people it focuses on cultures which at the time satisfied the authors defined characteristics of “Central Eurasian” culture. This fluid definition of the included cultures does create an interesting perspective to view history. The book gives some interesting perspectives on how the economic systems of nomadic controlled areas work and the importance of free trade. It also discussed how this was eventually over powered by the Western naval trade.</p>

<p>Overall, I thought the book offered some very interesting perspectives and presented the silk road in a new way. Unfortunately, I found much of the views express to skew towards the “Central Eurasian” cultures being the perfect good guys. They were merely peace-loving people who just wanted free trade. While many of the central eurasian cultures have been represented unfairly in past historical literature this seems to be a bit of an over correction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the history of Central Asia or historic economies but its skew has to be understood.</p>

    <h2 id="a-classic-but-slow-to-start---8510">A classic, but slow to start - 8.5/10</h2>

<p>I have tried to read <em>Dune</em> in the past and have never been able to get past the first couple chapters. 
I finally pushed through the start and made it through the book. Overall, the book is a classic. It tells an 
interesting story which can both be viewed on its own or tied to and related to the world around us.</p>

<p>From a literary standpoint the book starts a little slow. One of the annoying parts of the book is that some of the 
characters have <em>sci-fi</em> names while some have normal English names. Upon research this might have some sort of symbolic value but
it does really make the names a little difficult to remember and makes it harder to follow the plot in the beginning.</p>

<p><em>Dune</em> is one of those sci-fi books that you can really dig into and think about and not a simple read like <em>The Hitchhikers Guide</em> for example. I would recommend that any science fiction fans stomach the first hundred pages and read <em>Dune</em>, I definitely enjoyed teh book and will probably read some of the sequels.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The book details the history of central asia and the near east from the times of Alexander the Great to now. It portrays historical events in an interesting and intriguing way and documents its importance this region played in the early trade routes and modern petrochemical industry. Overall I found the more historical beginning of the book very interesting. Unfortunately, much of the book is dedicated to the history from the 1800’s on. Personally, I find the more distant past to be more interesting and I would only recommend the book someone with a strong interest in more modern history.</p>

    <p>The majority of this project is done and isn’t really going anywhere exciting anymore. I am going to touch up some of the game ot make it a little more playable and probably stop working on it.</p>

<h2 id="moving-stuff-around-and-making-the-game-a-little-more-playable">Moving Stuff around and making the game a little more playable</h2>

<p>A number of times during this process I have encountered stupid issues which could have been avoided had a spent a little time refactoring &amp; writing tests. I didn’t do this as I didn’t think this would be a complicated or time consuming of a project. Since the game psuedo works now I am going to to take the time to do some house keeping.</p>

<p>I added some authentication via Oauth with Github.</p>

<p>Additionally, I added user secrets and configuration registration. I used Rider spell check to fix a number of spelling mistakes and reformat a number of things.</p>

<p>Apparently, string interpolation does not work with fable/react and completely broke the site. I migrated everything from sprintf via the refactor and then had to manually redo it all which was endless fun.</p>

<p>I am trying to add a user management controller now. I tried using saturn cli. This conflicted with the safe template so I created it in a different repo and am trying to copy it over.</p>

        SafeCardGame - Step 15 - Predecks From Database

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Jun 2021</span>

    <h2 id="pulling-premade-decks-from-the-database">Pulling premade decks from the database</h2>

<p>I first implemented the repositories. While doing this I had to move the JSON parsing from the shared DTOs to the server project (as fable doesn’t support Newtonsoft JSON/ it performs weirdly). Additionally, I pulled out the row to DTO mappings into a shared module in the server project.</p>

<p>When implementing the repository for pulling cards from a deck I ordered by random to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shuffle</code> the deck on load like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">select c.* from card c inner join deck_card_association dca on dca.card_id  = c.card_id where dca.deck_id = @deck_id order by RANDOM()</code>.</p>

<p>I was then able to update the API to include new methods for the premade decks like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-fsharp" data-lang="fsharp"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">ICardGameApi</span> <span class="p">=</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">getPlayers</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">unit</span> <span class="p">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">Async</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Player</span> <span class="n">seq</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

    <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>which I then implemented like:</p>

<p>After testing this I have noticed that the attacks should use any available colored resources for colorless resources with no more colorless resources are available.</p>

<p>I was able to add this functionality by updating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tryRemoveResourceFromPlayerBoard</code> to be a recursive function that will try to remove available resources from colored types if colorless is needed and not available.</p>

<p>Additionally, to make this give preference to decrementing the colored before the colorless energy I had to order the application but sorting the resource pools like:</p>

<p>This now appears to be a low quality but playable game besides not having a win condition. I need to add the logic to actually cause a player to lose when they have zero or less health. (obviously currently you can do that first turn depending on the cards you draw which makes the game more exciting?)</p>

<p>I am leaving this as the final commit in the branch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">step-15-deck-repository</code>.</p>
