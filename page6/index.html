<p>Going into the book I was expecting some choice comically outdated computing knowledge from the the 1970s. Overall, I was extremely impressed by how well the book as held up and feel like that is a side effect of just how superb the book is. The book was easy to read and follow, seems approachable to all audiences and covers a good amount of basic topics. While teh discussions about selecting different types of 4-bit vs 8bit microprocessors are dated the points they bring up and thought process the book documents is still valid today and of value to anyone with an interest in technology and computing.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend this book to anyone interesting in learning or brushing up on the inner working of microprocessors.</p>

        Golang has a Really Awesome Development Experience/ Great Tooling
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Nov 2021</span>

    <p>Golang appears to be becoming very popular in software development market so I decided to take a look and play around with it a little. I ran through a few tutorials and video series giving an introduction to the language and it seems like a quality pretty straightforward c-style language. I think many of teh channel concepts and struct focus is pretty novel and really cool. I (played around with some code)[https://github.com/jamesclancy/GoTesting] but obviously this was a very surface level explorations of Golang.</p>

<p>My initial impression is that Golang appears to be capturing a couple of the traditional advantages which Microsoft used to embrace:</p>

<h2 id="1-the-opinoninated-nature-of-the-ecosystem">1. The opinoninated nature of the ecosystem</h2>

<p>One of Microsoft’s traditional advantages was that there was a suggested Microsoft way to perform many standard business operations. While Microsoft’s marketing is now moving from this opinionated nature, in my experience, this has made it significantly easier to manage, maintain and upgrade legacy and older applications created with Microsoft technologies and was one of the key advantages the Microsoft advantages. Today, Microsoft is really pushing the narrative that you can do things a million different ways. While this is fun and freeing it also can be a great way to build hard to maintain systems requiring specialized tribal knowledge. Golang appears to walk a nice middle path of freedom and opinionated design.</p>

<h2 id="2-great-tooling">2. Great tooling</h2>

<p>The generators work great. The compiler give great feedback. The Visual Studio Code extension provides a smooth experience and great feedback. I would argue setting up a full Golang development environment as powerful as Vanilla Visual Studio Pro was a not only faster but easier. It used to be that Microsoft Visual Studio was probably the easiest way to set up a development environment. Python, Node etc improved and became easier to install over time but didn’t provide good tooling. Setting up Golang in VS Code is the first development experience I have encountered which could rival the Microsoft easy to start development environment.</p>

<p>The book discusses a variety of strategies for building and fostering a “learning organization” this appears to have been a business fad in the 80s and 90s. Basically, the book describes ways to try to identify root causes for systems issues and over come them with a number of obligatory references to Japanese management systems.</p>

<p>While there was a good amount of jargony non-sense throughout the book, it also provided some solid ideas, concepts and processes which can be applied. Some of the major points of interest discussed included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identifying jumps of abstraction</li>
  <li>Reinforcing vs Balancing systems</li>
  <li>The concept of personal mastery</li>
  <li>The importance of local decision making and shared vision</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of interesting dated concepts, it also includes a chapter which appears to be dedicated to the then early field of business simulation and gamification. I found this and interesting perspective from the early days of personal computing.</p>

    <p>I was recently stuck with my laptop and no internet for an extended period and decided that testing out Sprectre.Console would be of interest. It turns out that <a href="https://github.com/spectreconsole">Sprectre.Console</a> turned out to be pretty cool.</p>

<p>Specre.Console allows for pretty console output it also seems to provide some nice abstractions over rewriting the console output and nice formating.</p>

    - Tables
    - Live reredering</p>

        A Secret Atlas by Michael A Stackpole

    <span class="post-date">08 Nov 2021</span>

    <h2 id="might-have-been-good-as-a-fantasy-book-but-not-for-me---610">Might have been good as a fantasy book but not for me. - 6/10</h2>

<p>I picked up this book because Stackpole was one of my favorite <em>Star Wars EU</em> authors but I do not generally read fantasy books.</p>

<p>In terms of interesting take-a-ways, this book was dedicated to John McCain. I had never thought about how similar the story of Corran Horn was to John McCain’s story. Corran Horn was the main “Stackpole-created” Star Wars character throughout the <em>New Jedi Order</em> and <em>X-Wing</em> books, he was a “maverick” POW who have to overcome and escape from the horrors of being tortured as a POW.</p>

<p>Overall, I thought the book was well written but as the first book in the <em>Age of Discovery</em> universe it didn’t clearly enough describe or set up the world. The book follows two brothers who come from a legendary family of cartographers as they leave home to explore and document strange and distant places. This is actually quite a novel idea, I liked the idea of following map makers in the age of exploration. A key part of the novel focuses on exciting new technology for accurately mapping both latitude and longitude and the book generally sends the two characters in very distinct and potentially interesting realms.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I did not care for the fantasy elements of the novel. The book includes many narratives about <em>wild magic</em>. This wild magic was unleashed by magic’s overuse during pass wars and now behaves <em>wildly</em> and comes in storms causing general chaos. I think this could have been an interest subject matter in a film or especially in a video game but in this book format I found it a little difficult to visualize &amp; follow. I may just lack imagination, but I don’t think the detail or descriptions was present to truly describe the world. The book was already quite long at over 600 pages and I think perhaps follow two different main characters through two distinct journeys was simply to aggressive of a goal. Perhaps if the scope of the world had been scaled down the general book would have been more engaging and better or perhaps I just don’t like fantasy novels.</p>

    <h2 id="a-story-about-veterinarians-working-for-an-interplanetary-strip-mining-company---1510">A Story about Veterinarians Working for an Interplanetary Strip Mining Company? - 1.5/10</h2>

<p>The general plot follows “xenobiologists” who work for an “energy extraction” company who find themselves stuck on a strange world populated by dinosaurs. This seemed like such a ridiculous plot that I figured this would be an interesting read. This assumption proved to be incorrect. This book was very slow to start, hard to read and has not aged well.</p>

<p>One aging issue is that the heros of the book at strip miners who are searching for energy sources? While they casually discuss destroying the planet and such they preachily discuss the merits of vegetarianism etc. Clearly, in the 1970s when the book was written the energy extraction industry was viewed in a much more positive more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forward</code> light.</p>

<p>Additionally, the book attempts to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adult</code> in very forced ways. A number of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mature</code> topics are forced into dialog throughout the novel in a way which suggests an immaturity of the author or expected audience. This is a common problem I have seen in a number of older sci-fi books that are clearly attempting to appear to both an adult and young adult audience. From a life lesson standpoint, this really highlight the value and necessity of targeting specific audiences and personas.</p>

<p>This is definitely not a book I would recommend but it does appear to have good Amazon reviews so perhaps I am just not the correct audience.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Guns, Germs and Steel is probably the most famous recent history book in pop culture– it is very easy to see why. The book is a very easy read and extremely approachable for anyone. The book doesn’t touch any particularly controversial issues and generally assumes the read has no background knowledge (i.e. no need to look things up on Wikipedia).</p>

<p>While I found the book a nice read and enjoyable I am giving it a 7.5 due to its lack of detail. I really would have liked to hear more details on how the Han culture spread spread China or more history on the spread of Bantu people across Sub-Saharian Africa. I understand he was just using them as examples to highlight the power of food production, population adn technology but I would have enjoyed spending some more time in the weeds. Overall, I feel like this book has given me a greater sense of curiosity about certain aspects of history and has inspired me to research more.</p>

    <h2 id="a-nostalgia-driven-book-from-a-by-gone-era-910">A nostalgia driven book from a by gone era. 9/10</h2>

<p>Beautiful Swimmers is the story of the Chesapeake’s Bay watermen through the lens of an outsider. Each chapter outlines a different area or time of year and discusses the livelihood and work of the local watermen and others involved in the seafood industry. The book is packed with nostalgia, largely the narrator is interacting with the older generation and discussing how things have changed adn how the seafood industry is slowing dying/changing. To compound the nostalgia the book was written in the 1970s and even the <em>modern</em> frame the narrator is quite dated and in and of itself nostalgia invoking.</p>

<p>Overall, the book served as a interesting and powerful piece of literature documenting the fading culture of the Chesapeake which own often remains completely unknown outside of Maryland and Virginia as it grips with overfishing, pollution and changing economics. Beautiful Swimmers is an informative and enjoyable read for anyone interested in seafood, the Chesapeake or environmentalism.</p>

        KafkaUI - General Idea
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Oct 2021</span>

    <p><em>I have been writing this blog post over several days and will probably break it into multiple logical parts when finished.</em></p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I recently attended the Kafka Summit Americas and have been experimenting with Kafka. One thing I have found lacking with Kafka vs other Pub-Sub systems is a management UI. I have previously used RabbitMQ and Azure Service Bus and both of those had quite useful tooling. Unfortunately, Kakfa largely utilizes helpful but not user friendly command line interfaces or commercial products. There appear to be a few user friendly clients like <a href="https://github.com/obsidiandynamics/kafdrop">KaDrop</a> and <a href="https://www.conduktor.io/">Conduktor</a> but these are still quite limited vs what you get built into something like Rabbit.</p>

<p>My thought was that it might be a useful try to build a new basic admin interface for Kafka, not one that would actually compete with the existing solution but rather one which fit what I needed and provide a good way to get more comfortable with Kafka. Overall, I don’t think this is all that viable <em>but</em> it did create a great environment to come up with some really informative if hacky solutions to short comings in the dotnet <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AdminClient</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Confluent.Kafka</code>.</p>

<h2 id="the-existing-tooling-for-dotnet---confluentkafka">The Existing tooling for dotnet - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Confluent.Kafka</code></h2>

<p>The core client for interfacing with Kafka in the dotnet ecosystem is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Confluent.Kafka</code> library, this appears to be quite limited vs the Java client library. Some limitations appear to be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Legacy style APIs which don’t all support async/await</li>
  <li>No streaming support</li>
  <li>Very limited administrative capabilities</li>
</ol>

<p>These appear to be known limitation related to the underlying <a href="https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka">librdkafka</a>. Generally, the client allows more general use cases of consuming and producing events but more advanced functionality.</p>

<p>Reading online, it appears that the guidance is not to try to manage the cluster directly using librdkafka client implementations but rather utilize the <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka-rest/index.html">Confluent REST APIs</a> which does look great but unfortunately is a Confluent (i.e. commercial) product and not a real part of Kafka itself, for now it seems like <em>good</em> solutions require Java or to utilize Confluent Licensed tools.</p>

<p>Out of general interest I wanted to see if I could come up with hacky solutions to try to perform similar functionality to Conduktor using only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Confluent.Kafka</code> and interfacing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Zookeeper</code>.</p>

<h3 id="initial-set-up">Initial Set Up</h3>

<p>First I set up a general scaffold of the UI and hooked up some ideal DTOs and set up a basic UI in MaterialUI.</p>

<p>The general project structure is set up like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Client
    |--&gt; Pages -&gt; 
    |           |--&gt; CommonLayoutItems - Shared Layout Components
                |
                |--&gt; Layout - General layout definition &amp; view
    |           |
    |           |--&gt; Brokers
    |           |
    |           |--&gt; Topics
    |           |
    |           |--&gt; Consumers
    |
    |--&gt; Models - Global event models
    |
    |--&gt; Index - Routing for requests into the various pages
    |
    |--&gt; App - Boilerplate set up for client App
Server
    |--&gt; Kafka Interface - Helper and functions built around the Kafka clients, 
                           used in the Api Implementations

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The pages will all share two general templates, there are informative pages and action pages.</p>

<p>Informative pages are divided into sections like:</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\post-media\2021-10-17-GeneralProjectIdea\general-page-layout.png" alt="Informative Page Example" /></p>

<p>Action pages are displayed as modals:</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\post-media\2021-10-17-GeneralProjectIdea\modal-page-layout.png" alt="Informative Page Example" /></p>

<h3 id="getting-the-topic-offsets--event-counts">Getting the Topic Offsets &amp; Event Counts</h3>

<p>Even looking through the <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/2.0.0/kafka-rest/docs/api.html#consumers">Rest Proxy Api Specs</a> I am not seeing this info available in the rest api.</p>

<p>Basically, for each topic I believe I want to compare the 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kafka-run-class kafka.tools.GetOffsetShell --broker-list=localhost:29092 --topic=testtopic --time -1</code> results to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kafka-run-class kafka.tools.GetOffsetShell --broker-list=localhost:29092 --topic=testtopic --time -2</code> for topics.</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\post-media\2021-10-17-GeneralProjectIdea\get-offset-shell-example.png" alt="Get Offset Example" /></p>

<p>For consumer groups I believe we want to simulate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server=localhost:29092 --group=testgroup --describe</code>.</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\post-media\2021-10-17-GeneralProjectIdea\kafka-consumer-groups-example.png" alt="Consumer Groups Example" /></p>

<p>I think I can replicate the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetOffsetShell</code> results by creating a starting at the beginning of time and then comparing the high and low watermark offsets. I am not entirely certain how accurate this would be and what would be the effect of compacted topics on these results. I feel like the best way to figure out is to test it.</p>

<p>Basically, I believe that if I use</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        let topicPartitions =
            topicMetadata.Partitions
            |&gt; Seq.map (fun x -&gt; new TopicPartition(topicMetadata.Topic, new Partition(x.PartitionId)))

        topicPartitions |&gt; consumer.Assign

        let res =
            consumer.Consume(System.TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(10.0))

        let offsets =
            topicPartitions
            |&gt; Seq.map consumer.GetWatermarkOffsets
            |&gt; Seq.toList
```  [Github link](https://github.com/jamesclancy/KafkaUI/blob/2b43f8f3562ac8dd65a785a5a8156b91daa33bcf/src/Server/KafkaInterface/ClientBuilder.fs#L252)

to pull watermarks and then sum them like:

</code></pre></div></div>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    this.TopicPartitionOffsets
    |&gt; Seq.filter (fun x -&gt; x.High.IsSpecial = false)
    |&gt; Seq.map (fun x -&gt; x.High.Value - x.Low.Value)
    |&gt; Seq.sum ``` [Github link](https://github.com/jamesclancy/KafkaUI/blob/2b43f8f3562ac8dd65a785a5a8156b91daa33bcf/src/Server/KafkaInterface/ClientBuilder.fs#L34)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I should be get the total events still in the topic.</p>

<p>I have seen and enjoyed the film but never read the book. I was pleasantly surprised that the book was even better then the film. Despite already knowing the general plot and what would happen, the book remanded a page turner and a quick read. While reading I even found myself stopping to look up information about the various types of dinosaurs on Wikipedia. I especially enjoyed the philosophical discussions of Malcolm, something I don’t remember being present or called out in the film.</p>
