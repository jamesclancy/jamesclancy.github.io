<p>Inspired by how I liked <em>Make It So</em> I decided to read more “pop” business books. I picked this up for free and it was not worth the price. The book could have been an article or something along those lines but was extended with fluff to fill out one hundred pages. I am assuming this was written to be given out at leadership workshops or something and is not meant to be taken as a serious book.</p>

    <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2021</span>

    <h2 id="best-book-in-the-original-dune-trilogy---9510">Best book in the original Dune Trilogy - 9.5/10</h2>

<p>The first <em>Dune</em> is the story of Paul’s rise, <em>Dune Messiah</em> is his fall and <em>Children of Dune</em> is the aftermath. Paul walked into the desert to finally die leaving the empire in the control of his sister, Alia. The novel discusses the aftermath of Paul’s death across the empire, Dune’s religion and follows Alia and Paul’s two children as they deal with the past knowledge they were born with.</p>

<h3 id="spoiler-warning">Spoiler Warning</h3>

<p>The book largely focuses on the concepts of discipline and self control. The story of Paul’s suicide is now framed as his submission and acceptance of spice addiction and Alia’s mental state is shown to have been destroyed by spice. Paul’s children are only able to maintain sanity by obtaining from any spice conception despite forces around them trying to force it and <em>prescience</em> on them.</p>

<p>Out of all the <em>Dune</em> books this definitely tells a story which relates and reflects the real world on a higher level and serves as an excellent warning story about self indulgence, hedonism and short term thinking.</p>

    <h2 id="easy-to-read-but-very-outdated-perhaps-a-newer-edition-would-be-better---610">Easy to read but very outdated. Perhaps a newer edition would be better - 6/10</h2>

<p>The book explains communication as a cycle of message and response which happens inside the context of a culture. I can actually see the techniques discussed in the book utilized in the  prose of the book and they do work. The book was well structured, easy to read and to skim and to understand. I feel like I was able to get a good amount of reminders about proper business writing from the book but unfortunately much of the information in the book is outdated (the book is from 2012). I assume there is a more recent version of the book (I picked this up for free at a book give-a-way) but many of the concepts and details discussed in the book don’t really apply in a work of Teams, Confluence, Slack and Zoom.</p>

<p>While the core concepts of communicator and audience strategy still apply I feel that much of the meat of the book focused on the details of message, channel and cultural strategies which I think have all changed substantially over the last decade. This was a decent refresher course on professional writing and the book was the right price (free) but I would certainly opt for a newer edition if a reader is planning on actually purchasing a copy.</p>

<p>The book walks though a number of Star Trek TNG episodes which illustrate good leadership qualities.</p>

<h2 id="my-impressions">My Impressions</h2>

<p>This was a very easy read and felt that the summaries of the TNG episode inspired nostalgia and will probably inspire me to rewatch some <em>Next Generation</em>. The book definitely declined and became more and more of a stretch as the books went on but the book remained entertaining throughout. In particular, I thought some of the chapters like “Interdependence” were very very weak.</p>

<p>Generally, it reads like someone set out with a list of leadership qualities and tried there best to find episodes which illustrated them. I think this makes a lot of sense from a formulaic book standpoint but it is not idea.</p>

<p>Overall, I will be watching out for other “pop-business” books and “pop-philosophy” books at <a href="https://bookthing.org/">BookThing</a> the next time I go. I wouldn’t pay for the book but for free it is worth the time to read.</p>

<p>This book follows the conflict between the rule of two and the natural progression of the Sith apprentices to overtake their masters. Zannah must finally over take Bane and begin the “Dynasty” of the new Sith. Nothing to exciting happened throughout the books but it was a decent quick read. The characters were a little more developed then in <em>Rule of Two</em> and I thought the final events of the book were pretty well done.</p>

<p>The book follows the journey of a new Sith Padawan as she progresses from a child to a true <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sith</code>. This is somewhat of a contrived concept that has been done a million times before. The book is “fine” though” I had heard the “Darth Bane” books were very good, I would disagree and thing this was just mediocure. The book contains lots of generic action scenes and generic sith like behaviors. Generally, the book doesn’t do anything to exciting it seems like another <em>Star Wars</em> fluff novel.</p>

    <h2 id="extremely-formulaic-but-decently-executed---610">Extremely formulaic but decently executed. - 6/10</h2>

<p>This is a quintessential basic Star Wars book focused on main film characters. Nothing really happens, the characters don’t develop or do anything surprising. Basically the book focuses is a meaningless stream of event structured to allow Obi-Wan to demonstrate wisdom and Anakin to demonstrate how headstrong and conflicted he is. The book isn’t really bad and is an easy read but wasn’t very interesting. The book highlights the issue with all the the “main character” centric books outside of the New Jedi Order and after timeline, they had to be safe and fit in with the other preestablished stories so nothing to major can happen.</p>

    <h2 id="very-different-from-the-original-dune-but-just-as-good---8510">Very different from the original Dune but just as good. - 8.5/10</h2>

<p>The second book in the Dune series takes place a decade and a half after the first. Paul is now a God-Emperor who has turned his back on the ways of the desert and become trapped in a world of politics and backstabbing.</p>

<h3 id="spoiler-warning">Spoiler Warning</h3>

<p>The book largely focuses on the guilt that Paul feels for leading his now completed religious war, palace intrigue and his eventual downfall. The book moves at a much fast pace then the previous installment and is a much easy read (i.e. the names simpler/easier to follow). The book does introduce a number of weird events that are never explained. For example why was there a random nuclear explosion which blinded Paul. They seemed surprised that someone would use nuclear weapons so why was the reasoning or who did it not addressed? Additionally, why are nuclear explosions so heavily associated with going blind? I liked the over arching theme of vision through the book but this was a bit much? In the distant Dune future have they cured all other effects of radiation? The book made it sound like the radiation vaporized peoples eyes so they were left were left with empty sockets? I know this was all to try to emphasize the importance of fore<em>sight</em> and the prescience but this was over the top enough to bother me.</p>
