title: Golang has a Really Awesome Development Experience/ Great Tooling

Golang appears to be becoming very popular in software development market so I decided to take a look and play around with it a little. I ran through a few tutorials and video series giving an introduction to the language and it seems like a quality pretty straightforward c-style language. I think many of teh channel concepts and struct focus is pretty novel and really cool. I (played around with some code)[https://github.com/jamesclancy/GoTesting] but obviously this was a very surface level explorations of Golang. 

My initial impression is that Golang appears to be capturing a couple of the traditional advantages which Microsoft used to embrace:

## 1. The opinoninated nature of the ecosystem

One of Microsoft's traditional advantages was that there was a suggested Microsoft way to perform many standard business operations. While Microsoft's marketing is now moving from this opinionated nature, in my experience, this has made it significantly easier to manage, maintain and upgrade legacy and older applications created with Microsoft technologies and was one of the key advantages the Microsoft advantages. Today, Microsoft is really pushing the narrative that you can do things a million different ways. While this is fun and freeing it also can be a great way to build hard to maintain systems requiring specialized tribal knowledge. Golang appears to walk a nice middle path of freedom and opinionated design. 

## 2. Great tooling

The generators work great. The compiler give great feedback. The Visual Studio Code extension provides a smooth experience and great feedback. I would argue setting up a full Golang development environment as powerful as Vanilla Visual Studio Pro was a not only faster but easier. It used to be that Microsoft Visual Studio was probably the easiest way to set up a development environment. Python, Node etc improved and became easier to install over time but didn't provide good tooling. Setting up Golang in VS Code is the first development experience I have encountered which could rival the Microsoft easy to start development environment.
