I was recently stuck with my laptop and no internet for an extended period and decided that testing out Sprectre.Console would be of interest. It turns out that [Sprectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole) turned out to be pretty cool.

Specre.Console allows for pretty console output it also seems to provide some nice abstractions over rewriting the console output and nice formating. 

It supports awesome features like:
    - Emojis
    - Tables
    - Live reredering

An example of a simple map renderer I created using Spectre.Console can be seen [here](https://github.com/jamesclancy/TextRTS).
