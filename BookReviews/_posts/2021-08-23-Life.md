## Thought the beginning was a bit of a bore but enjoyed the later parts of the history - 7/10


## Summary

The book starts with at the creation of the earth and maps out how life evolved and developed up until the formation of humanity and modern *recorded history*. The book attempts to straddle the line between popular science and academic information delivering a level of accessible detail which appears accurate but it still approachable to a non-biologist.

## My Impressions

The book begins at the beginning of the Earth and slowly moves through history towards the modern age. Throughout the book a number of species are discussed and the general evolution and development of life is discussed in moderate detail. My background knowledge of the discussed species increases very dramatically as the book progressed making the book become more and more engaging. Especially in the pre-cambrian parts of the book I had very little background on what the discussed species were and had to repeatably looks up the species on wikipedia to understand what was being discussed. From my experiences in the American public school system I don't think I am alone in my previous education's focus on recent (dinosaur and post-dinosaur) biology. I think it would have made for a much better reading experience if simpler examples or greater detail were embedded in the earlier parts of the book to prevent this wikipedia back and forth.
