## A decent book but not the same level as The Corner 7.5/10

_Homicide_ tells the stories of homicide detectives that David Simon followed during 1988. The book follows the more traumatic cases several detectives encountered and their following investigations. The book served as the inspiration for the TV show _Homicide_ and _Law and Order_.

The stories in the book are interesting and well told but the characters were not as developed or relatable as the character's in _The Corner_. Through out _Homicide_ things are happening around the characters, they are not teh ones driving their own destiny and their choices and decisions are mostly glossed over. While it is a good book and worth reading it is not on the same level as _The Corner_ and like comparing _law and Order_ to _The Wire_.
