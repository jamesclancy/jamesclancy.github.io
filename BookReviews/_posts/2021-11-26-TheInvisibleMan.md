## Book still holds up as a great read 8/10

_The Invisible Man_ is another classic book I recently picked up for free. Unlike _Frankenstein_ this book was still interesting and worth a read despite age. The story telling was interesting and the plot engaging. While the book does contain some dated concepts the book remains a readable tale told from an interesting perspective. The played up English accents in this book were still readable while adding to the atmosphere of the setting.

HG Wells does an excellent job of describing a detestable yet understandable character in the invisible man. As opposed to the lovable villain the book features an understandable jerk who backs himself into a bad situation, I feel like this creates an interesting narrative I don't often see. 

I would recommend this book for anyone who like Science Fiction or classical literature.
