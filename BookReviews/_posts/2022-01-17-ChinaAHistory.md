## A book which while not riveting does walk through a good amount of history - 6/10

_China A History_ walks through the long recorded history of China. It throughout the book it attempts to highlight important events both in relationship to the world at the time in the current geopolitical environment. I feel as though I learned a good amount more about Chinese history and the various dynasties. Due to its length, the book didn't attempt to go into any great detail and really did a great job of focusing on the ways in which the events resonate and drive the environment today. 

From an intellectual standpoint the book was excellent, it was plainly written and  _very_ boring through. Clearly it was written as a academic exorcise and not meant for general consumption. It was pretty hard to get through and despite being only 500 pages felt like it took an eternity to get through. I would only recommend this to someone which a very strong interest in Chinese history as it certainly isn't for the weak of spirit.
