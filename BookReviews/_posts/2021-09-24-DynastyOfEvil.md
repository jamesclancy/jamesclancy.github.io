## Somewhat generic but more entertaining then Rule of Two - 7.5/10

This book follows the conflict between the rule of two and the natural progression of the Sith apprentices to overtake their masters. Zannah must finally over take Bane and begin the "Dynasty" of the new Sith. Nothing to exciting happened throughout the books but it was a decent quick read. The characters were a little more developed then in *Rule of Two* and I thought the final events of the book were pretty well done.
