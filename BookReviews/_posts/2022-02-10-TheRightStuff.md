## Remarkably information while horrifically boring - 4/10

_Gideon's Trumpet_ details how one man's court case reshaped the American legal system. Gideon, a small time gambler from Florida was convicted of burglary in a case where he could not afford legal representation. Because the case was in a state court and Florida at the time did not guarantee legal representation he was forced to represent himself and lost. He was eventually able to appeal the case to the Supreme Court in the case _Gideon v. Wainwright_. The Supreme Court ruled for Gideon and in turn guaranteed the right to representation in all criminal cases.

The book was quite informative and made me realize how little I knew about the workings of the American legal system. It also served to remind how astonishing boring and bureaucratic the legal system is and why I generally have not spent much time reading about it in the past. Maybe it is worthwhile to read this book if you are very interested in the legal system but I am assuming if you are already interested in the legal system you would get very little from the book.
