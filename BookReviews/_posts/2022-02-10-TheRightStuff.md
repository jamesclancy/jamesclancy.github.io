## Enjoyable but not a classic - 7.5/10

_The Right Stuff_ is an epic novel about the first American astronauts in the Mercury program. The book describes the personalities and general history surrounding the Mercury Seven and there wives. 

While the novel does ver in the direction of gonzo journalism I felt this book was a nice half step from traditional journalism into the form of writing made famous by Hunter Thompson. I did enjoy the book and found it very engaging but I don't think it delivered the excitement of books like _Hells Angels_. I think part of this because of teh subject matter but part is also the style. I would recommend this book to anyone but wouldn't classify this as a must read.
