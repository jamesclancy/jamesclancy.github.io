## Clearly culturally significant but kind of boring /10

_King Solomon's Mines_ tells the story of several big game hunters who travel north from Durban (ZA) to attempt to locate a legendary diamond mine from a centuries old Portegese map and look for the protagonists brother. At the novels writing at the end of the 1800's the areas north of the Natal in South Africa remained largely unexplored by European explorers and a mystery to Victorian society. 

_King Solomon's Mines_ served as the basis and inspiration for the genre of _Lost World_ novels and stories. The impact this book had on great novels like the _The Heart of Darkness_ and _Tarzan_. The book was clearly dated but moved at a decent pace and was of an appropiate length. I didn't find the book particularly riveting but was a worthwhile read as someone who is a fan of the _Lost World_ genre.
