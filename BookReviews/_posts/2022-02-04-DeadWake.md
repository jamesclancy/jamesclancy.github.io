## Interesting and engaging historical narrative - 7/10

_Dead Wake_ tells the true story of the British passenger vessel the Lusitania on its final journey and how its sinking brought the US into World War I. The book America's desire to stay out of the fighting of WWI while profiting from the European's demand for both weapons and necessary supplies. In an attempt to prevent supplies from reaching the United Kingdom German UBoats began targeting non-military shipping in a region around the UK. The Lusitania was a large passenger liner traveling from NYC to Liverpool which was thought to be impervious from German attack as it contained many American passengers. It was eventually sunk causing a public outcry and dragging the United States into the War.

I found _Dead Wake_ to be compelling and interest holding as a book and informative as a historical source. I knew vaguely that U-Boats were introduced in WWI but generally associate them with WWII. I feel as though I learned a good amount the forces driving America into the "Great War" and provided me with some valuable historical perspective on a subject matter ofter overlooked in history class. I would recommend the book for individuals with an interest in American history.
