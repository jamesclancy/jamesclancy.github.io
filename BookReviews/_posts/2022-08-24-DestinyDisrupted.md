## Interesting details but limited in scope 7/10

_Destiny Disrupted_ tells the history of the world since the founding of Islam through an Islamic perspective. The title generally focused on the middle east, north africa and south asia and told histories that while known are not front and center in western education. 

Overall, parts of the book were interesting but I feel that book failed to paint a different picture of teh world. It merely drove _slightly_ deeper in history relevant to the Islamic world.
