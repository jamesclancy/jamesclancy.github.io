## Alright but not great 7/10

_The Andromeda Strain_ is a novel about a government program to research extraterrestrial life. This research brings a dangerous disease to the Earth and a team of government scientists have to work quickly to fine a way to treat or contain the disease.

I found this book to be much weaker than _Congo_ or _Jurassic Park_. The story was moderately engaging and entertaining but not a page turner. While teh book starts out exciting the story and storytelling slowly unravels into sort of a mess. By the end, the conclusion of the book was murky and not very satisfying. The book was fine but not really worth seeking out.
