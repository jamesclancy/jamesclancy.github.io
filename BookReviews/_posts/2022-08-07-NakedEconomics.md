## Mildly interesting but not particularly notable - 7/10

_Naked Economics_ describes the economy in a whimsical and supposedly approachable way. The book was a relatively easy read and very approachable. Unfortunately the book didn't dive deep enough in to any particular subjects to really generate real interest. Like liked that the book didn't shy away from controversial topics like human capital, government market interference and globalism, but all topics in the book were only covered on a surface level.
