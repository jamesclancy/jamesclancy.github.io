## Historical parts were very interesting but focused to much on modern history - 7/10

## Summary

The book details the history of central asia and the near east from the times of Alexander the Great to now. It portrays historical events in an interesting and intriguing way and documents its importance this region played in the early trade routes and modern petrochemical industry. Overall I found the more historical beginning of the book very interesting. Unfortunately, much of the book is dedicated to the history from the 1800's on. Personally, I find the more distant past to be more interesting and I would only recommend the book someone with a strong interest in more modern history.
