## A nostalgia driven book from a by gone era. 9/10

Beautiful Swimmers is the story of the Chesapeake's Bay watermen through the lens of an outsider. Each chapter outlines a different area or time of year and discusses the livelihood and work of the local watermen and others involved in the seafood industry. The book is packed with nostalgia, largely the narrator is interacting with the older generation and discussing how things have changed adn how the seafood industry is slowing dying/changing. To compound the nostalgia the book was written in the 1970s and even the _modern_ frame the narrator is quite dated and in and of itself nostalgia invoking. 

Overall, the book served as a interesting and powerful piece of literature documenting the fading culture of the Chesapeake which own often remains completely unknown outside of Maryland and Virginia as it grips with overfishing, pollution and changing economics. Beautiful Swimmers is an informative and enjoyable read for anyone interested in seafood, the Chesapeake or environmentalism.
