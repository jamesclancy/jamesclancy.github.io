## Amazing piece of literature 9/10

_Hell's Angels_ is a classic book by the famed reporter Hunter Thompson. The book recants stories of Hunter Thompson's time spending a year with the motorcycle group Hells Angels. Hunter provides entertaining but likely largely exaggerated tales of fights parties and anti-social behavior he witnessed spending time with the group.

I had previously read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail. While these were both entertaining and engaging books I found Hell's Angels even more compelling. I wouldn't trust the book as an accurate historical account but I found the dynamic complexities of the sixties counter extremely interesting. I had never heard much about the interactions between the flower child counter culture and motorcycle group before and while I always knew they were counter culture groups from the same time period I never really thought of how they interacted.

I would recommend this book to anyone.
