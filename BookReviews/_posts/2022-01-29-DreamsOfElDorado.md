title: Dreams of El Dorado - A History of the American West by H. W. Brands
author: James Clancy
tags: books history old-west

## Very engaging historical book and a real non-fiction page turner 9.5/10

_Dreams of El Dorado_ discusses the early history of the United States expanding westward from the Mississippi. The book discusses the acquisition of new territories, the journeys of settlers and the new lands' eventual movement toward statehood. 

Often non-fiction can be dry and while interesting not engaging. _Dreams of El Dorado_ does an amazing job of creating an exciting narrative which flows fluidly through American history weaving together desperate and disjoint events into a compelling narrative that creates a novel level of "page-turn"-ability.

A must read for anyone with an interest in the history of the Old West.
