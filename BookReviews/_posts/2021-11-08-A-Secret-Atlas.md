## Might have been good as a fantasy book but not for me. - 6/10

I picked up this book because Stackpole was one of my favorite _Star Wars EU_ authors but I do not generally read fantasy books. 

In terms of interesting take-a-ways, this book was dedicated to John McCain. I had never thought about how similar the story of Corran Horn was to John McCain's story. Corran Horn was the main "Stackpole-created" Star Wars character throughout the _New Jedi Order_ and _X-Wing_ books, he was a "maverick" POW who have to overcome and escape from the horrors of being tortured as a POW.

Overall, I thought the book was well written but as the first book in the _Age of Discovery_ universe it didn't clearly enough describe or set up the world. The book follows two brothers who come from a legendary family of cartographers as they leave home to explore and document strange and distant places. This is actually quite a novel idea, I liked the idea of following map makers in the age of exploration. A key part of the novel focuses on exciting new technology for accurately mapping both latitude and longitude and the book generally sends the two characters in very distinct and potentially interesting realms. 

Unfortunately, I did not care for the fantasy elements of the novel. The book includes many narratives about _wild magic_. This wild magic was unleashed by magic's overuse during pass wars and now behaves _wildly_ and comes in storms causing general chaos. I think this could have been an interest subject matter in a film or especially in a video game but in this book format I found it a little difficult to visualize & follow. I may just lack imagination, but I don't think the detail or descriptions was present to truly describe the world. The book was already quite long at over 600 pages and I think perhaps follow two different main characters through two distinct journeys was simply to aggressive of a goal. Perhaps if the scope of the world had been scaled down the general book would have been more engaging and better or perhaps I just don't like fantasy novels.
