## Very Salesy but Overall I thought it was a good explanation of Sagas and Orchestration and Chorography- 7.5/10

_Practical Process Automation_ outlines some strategies for orchestrating processes and practices for managing workflows across multiple systems. The book is free and is definitely sales material but does contain some interesting information. I enjoyed the discussion about orchestration vs choreography and the liked the explanations of commands vs events and there boundaries at the edges of bound contexts.

Overall it is a quick read and not bad to get more familiar with modeling sagas and workflows.
