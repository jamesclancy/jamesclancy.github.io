## Boring and not worth reading - 5/10

I picked up a free copy of Frankenstein recently as it is supposed to be a classic piece of literature and I have not read it (that I can remember). The book, while well and decoratively written, was quite boring. The frame story model might have been novel when the book was first written but today is quite common and didn't really add much to the novel. The main thing going for the book was its short length but the way the characters droned on about topics I have no interest or investment in caused mer to rate this book a five out of ten.

This is a book to only read if assigned in school or in some other way required.
