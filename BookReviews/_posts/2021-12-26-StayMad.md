## Not very informative but easy to read 6/10

## Summary

The book goes through ways to spend less and invest saving for the future and the near future. 

## My Impressions

This book is extremely basic, basically it says to spend less and put money into a diversified stock portfolio. I don't think I really got anything out of the book in terms of usable information but I really wasn't expecting to. The book was a very quick and easy read and was moderately entertaining throughout so I wouldn't describe it as a bad book just really basic. I would recommend this book maybe to teenagers or younger people when they get there first job, I think it does do a great job of emphasizing the importance of compounding interest and investing early.
