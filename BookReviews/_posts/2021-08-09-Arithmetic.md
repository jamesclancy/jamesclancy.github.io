## Amazing book about the history and art of counting - 10/10

## Summary

The book discusses the role of Arithmetic and counting through history. Largely the book's focus isn't to teach the reader how to do elementary arithmetic but rather to highlight the beauty of the patterns we can find in numbers and how those enable us to perform tasks better.

## My Impressions

I found this to be one of the more approachable and better mathematics related books I have read and I will recommend it to anyone, even those without a math background. The author took advantage of the simplicity of the arithmetic domain to focus on the underlying art of finding and utilizing patterns around us without getting bogged down in any in depth technical discussions or details.
