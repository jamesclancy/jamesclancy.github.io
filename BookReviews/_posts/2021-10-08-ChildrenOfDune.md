## Best book in the original Dune Trilogy - 9.5/10

The first _Dune_ is the story of Paul's rise, _Dune Messiah_ is his fall and _Children of Dune_ is the aftermath. Paul walked into the desert to finally die leaving the empire in the control of his sister, Alia. The novel discusses the aftermath of Paul's death across the empire, Dune's religion and follows Alia and Paul's two children as they deal with the past knowledge they were born with. 

### Spoiler Warning

The book largely focuses on the concepts of discipline and self control. The story of Paul's suicide is now framed as his submission and acceptance of spice addiction and Alia's mental state is shown to have been destroyed by spice. Paul's children are only able to maintain sanity by obtaining from any spice conception despite forces around them trying to force it and _prescience_ on them. 

Out of all the _Dune_ books this definitely tells a story which relates and reflects the real world on a higher level and serves as an excellent warning story about self indulgence, hedonism and short term thinking.
