## A somewhat generic introduction to OKRs - 6.5/10

The book outlines an example of a startup utilizing OKRs then dives into strategies to implement them in the real work. Overall, the book is very brief which is botha blessing and a curse. While the book required very little time to read it also provided very little information about the implementation and setup of OKRs in an organization. Many topics such as exploratory OKRs and reevaluating goals were briefly touched on but the title provides no real insights into their implementation of or the various implications they could have. Overall, the book is an easy read which provides a decent introduction to the concept of OKRs while lacking the meat to provide a reader with the necessary knowledge to actually implement them.
