## Extremely formulaic but decently executed. - 6/10


This is a quintessential basic Star Wars book focused on main film characters. Nothing really happens, the characters don't develop or do anything surprising. Basically the book focuses is a meaningless stream of event structured to allow Obi-Wan to demonstrate wisdom and Anakin to demonstrate how headstrong and conflicted he is. The book isn't really bad and is an easy read but wasn't very interesting. The book highlights the issue with all the the "main character" centric books outside of the New Jedi Order and after timeline, they had to be safe and fit in with the other preestablished stories so nothing to major can happen.
