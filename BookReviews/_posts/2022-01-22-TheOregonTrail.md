## Quite dated and pretty boring 4/10

_The Oregon Trail_ is a travel log written from the perspective of an Easterner the mid-1800s attempting to explore the old west by traveling the Oregon Trail. During this adventure the writer documents his interactions with Native Americans, Mexicans and Frenchmen in the area. The book portrays the world from a bigoted viewpoint which was probably the norm at the time was written but is now quite shocking. 

Throughout the book the speaker is generally not likable from a modern perspective. The speaker is bigoted, self important and poorly prepared. He spends a good amount of time discussing his amusement at the local population and their "savagery". While It is important to remember and understand historical viewpoints that have shaped our history, the book has neither the valuable first hand accounts or literary quality to warrant a read coming off mostly as the musings of a bigoted man ill prepared for the world while judging and degrading those who helped him survive.
