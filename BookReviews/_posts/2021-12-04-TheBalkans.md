## Interesting topic and interesting book that unfortunately does go into enough detail. 7/10

_The Balkans_ was a long but entertaining read. The history of the Balkan peninsula was fascinating and I am surprised by how many blind spots I had to the history of the Austria-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires after my general American education. 

I think the book did its best to focus on large events that impacted the west while still providing enough local history to set the settings and attempt to give the events some sort of context. Unfortunately, I feel that the authored erred to far on the side of conciseness and didn't provide sufficient detail to give context of the intricacies of more recent Balkan events. Generally, it seemed like Albania, Slovenia, Bulgaria etc where left as almost a side note throughout much of the histories described and far to much focus was directed at the economic burdens caused by the Greek financial crisis and not the benefits, advantages and changes taking place across the Balkans as countries become more and more integrated with the European Union and the Western markets. 

This book was interesting but it definitely left me unsatisfied and with a desire to read and learn more about the historical context of event in the Balkans.
