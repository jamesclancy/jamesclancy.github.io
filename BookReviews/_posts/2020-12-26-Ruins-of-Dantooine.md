# Possibly the most boring Star Wars book I have read - 1/10

# Summary
A remarkably forgettable and basic story of a several imperial agents who try to try to steal information for the rebellion. The book is clearly written as a way to milk money from the *Star Wars Galaxies* franchise. I would avoid reading unless you really *need* to read all the books.
