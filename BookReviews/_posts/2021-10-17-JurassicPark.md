## A well written and exciting sci-fi thriller - 8.5 / 10

I have seen and enjoyed the film but never read the book. I was pleasantly surprised that the book was even better then the film. Despite already knowing the general plot and what would happen, the book remanded a page turner and a quick read. While reading I even found myself stopping to look up information about the various types of dinosaurs on Wikipedia. I especially enjoyed the philosophical discussions of Malcolm, something I don't remember being present or called out in the film.
