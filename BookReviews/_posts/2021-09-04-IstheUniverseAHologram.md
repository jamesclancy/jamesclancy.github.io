## This book was boring, repetitive and hard to get through. - 2/10


## Summary

The book is written in a question and answer format where the author _Plasencia_ interviews scientists and academics about philosophical issues relating to their work. May of the discusions centered around how the internet was providing a way for people to become more and more connected. 

## My Impressions

Overall the general prose of the book was poorly written. I am not certain if the text was intentionally written in a _simple_ way, but it ended sounding like it was written by a freshman high school student and not very engaging. 

None of the topics were discussed in great detail and many of the topics were repetitive if people making references to _Web 2.0_ over and over. Most QA sessions were < 10 pages including and intro and notes meaning < 7-8 pages of content. This meant that the expert would just respond to the generic, yet profound sounding, question on a very surface level and chapter would end. 

Additionally, the book is very pro-MIT. It was published by MIT Press so I would assume it would show MIT in a positive light but this book seemed like a vehicle for MIT to pat itself on the back.
