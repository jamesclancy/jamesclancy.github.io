## Very different from the original Dune but just as good. - 8.5/10


The second book in the Dune series takes place a decade and a half after the first. Paul is now a God-Emperor who has turned his back on the ways of the desert and become trapped in a world of politics and backstabbing. 

### Spoiler Warning

The book largely focuses on the guilt that Paul feels for leading his now completed religious war, palace intrigue and his eventual downfall. The book moves at a much fast pace then the previous installment and is a much easy read (i.e. the names simpler/easier to follow). The book does introduce a number of weird events that are never explained. For example why was there a random nuclear explosion which blinded Paul. They seemed surprised that someone would use nuclear weapons so why was the reasoning or who did it not addressed? Additionally, why are nuclear explosions so heavily associated with going blind? I liked the over arching theme of vision through the book but this was a bit much? In the distant Dune future have they cured all other effects of radiation? The book made it sound like the radiation vaporized peoples eyes so they were left were left with empty sockets? I know this was all to try to emphasize the importance of fore*sight* and the prescience but this was over the top enough to bother me.
