## A very good book about identifying the underlying patterns and structures at play - 8/10

The book discusses a variety of strategies for building and fostering a "learning organization" this appears to have been a business fad in the 80s and 90s. Basically, the book describes ways to try to identify root causes for systems issues and over come them with a number of obligatory references to Japanese management systems. 

While there was a good amount of jargony non-sense throughout the book, it also provided some solid ideas, concepts and processes which can be applied. Some of the major points of interest discussed included:
* Identifying jumps of abstraction
* Reinforcing vs Balancing systems
* The concept of personal mastery
* The importance of local decision making and shared vision

In terms of interesting dated concepts, it also includes a chapter which appears to be dedicated to the then early field of business simulation and gamification. I found this and interesting perspective from the early days of personal computing.
