## A pop business book which was a bit of a stretch but an enjoyable read - 8/10

The book walks though a number of Star Trek TNG episodes which illustrate good leadership qualities. 

## My Impressions

This was a very easy read and felt that the summaries of the TNG episode inspired nostalgia and will probably inspire me to rewatch some *Next Generation*. The book definitely declined and became more and more of a stretch as the books went on but the book remained entertaining throughout. In particular, I thought some of the chapters like "Interdependence" were very very weak. 

Generally, it reads like someone set out with a list of leadership qualities and tried there best to find episodes which illustrated them. I think this makes a lot of sense from a formulaic book standpoint but it is not idea. 

Overall, I will be watching out for other "pop-business" books and "pop-philosophy" books at BookThing the next time I go. I wouldn't pay for the book but for free it is worth the time to read.
