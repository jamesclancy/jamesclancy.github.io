## Very generic but decent predicable twists - 6.5/10

The book follows the journey of a new Sith Padawan as she progresses from a child to a true `sith`. This is somewhat of a contrived concept that has been done a million times before. The book is "fine" though" I had heard the "Darth Bane" books were very good, I would disagree and thing this was just mediocure. The book contains lots of generic action scenes and generic sith like behaviors. Generally, the book doesn't do anything to exciting it seems like another *Star Wars* fluff novel.
