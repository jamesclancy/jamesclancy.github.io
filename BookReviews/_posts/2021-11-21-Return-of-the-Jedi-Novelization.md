## Better then the film but the films are still the worst part of the Star Wars Universe - 6/10

I grew up with Star Wars books and video games. As a child, _Star Wars_ was never about the films but rather was _X-Wing vs Tie-Fighter_ and the _Hand of Thrawn_ trilogy. While I have seen the films they have always be secondary artifacts in the Star Wars Universe.

I believe I read some of the prequel books when I was a kid but haven't read the novelizations of the original films, I recently saw _The Return of the Jedi_ for free and decided to give it a try. 

Overall, the book is okay but being based on the movie doesn't have that much happening or that much character development. The book is relatively short (~180pg mass market paper back) and an easy read. The plot, the narrative and character development matched the film and doesn't really compare to the literary world and narrative building found in _Stackpole_ and _Zahn_ Star Wars EU books. 

This book might be worth while to read if you find it for free and are a big Start Wars fan but I definitely wouldn't recommend paying for it. The book is quite meh and reminiscent of many mediocre franchise exploiting video games and books that come out after every major film is released.
