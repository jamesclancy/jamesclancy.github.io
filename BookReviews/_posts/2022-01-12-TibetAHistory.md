## Somewhat dry book focusing too much on legends instead of history 5.5/10

_Tibet A History_ outlines the history of the Tibetan people, Tibet and the Tibetan Buddhism from the 700s till today. The book was frankly boring. While the book was at least brief, most of the history is presented with little elaboration or detail and much of the book seems to function like an annotated timeline merely listing events as they occur. This is quite annoying especially in early history when it lists out the effects of magic and mythical battles. The book does become slightly more detailed and more engaging as it moves into the twentieth century and I wouldn't say the book is bad exactly just not very entertaining. 

While I haven't read much on the subject matter, I assume there has to be a much better book covering similar topics in a much better way. I would still recommend reading the book if you are interested in the subject matter and can pick it up easily/ for free but I certainly would not seek it out.
