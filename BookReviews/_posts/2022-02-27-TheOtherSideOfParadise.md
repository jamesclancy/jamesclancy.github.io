## Mediocre at best 5/10

_The Other Side of Paradise_ is a group of stories written based on the authors time as a Tourist in Cuba. The book follows several characters as they try to cope with growing up partially connected to the modern world in shut of Cuba. 

The characters in teh book are largely boring and not particularly interesting. While the book is well written the other all story is quite bland and not very memorable.
