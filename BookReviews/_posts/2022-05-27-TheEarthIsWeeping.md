## A little slow but still worth a read 7/10

_The Earth Is Weeping_ details the various military conflicts between the American Army and various Native American Groups on the plains after the Civil War. The book is significantly more focused on military battles then other books I have read on the subject matter like _Dreams od El Dorado_ or _Empire of the Summer Moon_. The military focus of the book does lead it to be a bit drier and less exciting then other books but the book does present a good amount of the information and was clearly well researched and well written. 

Overall, I would have liked more personality and a more human perspective to be included in the book to make it a little more interesting but the book was certainly informative and perfectly readable for anyone with any sort of interest in the old west.
