## Very disappointing, too long, too many character and too little happening /10

_A Game of Thrones_ started the _A Song of Ice and Fire_ books on a decent foot. It set up a universe full of dramatic events which presented a lot of potential as a potential canvas for exciting stories to told on. The remaining 4 published books in the series (_A Clash of Kings_, _A Storm of Swords_, _A Feast for Crows_, _A Dance with Dragons_) were all long and boring. The shear number of characters introduced continued to increase as the books progressed with all the characters being largely forgettable and mostly interchangeable. The conflicts became more and more prevalent and petty as the book progressed. Not only did the the events have a lower bar of significance but their effects were more localize and effecting smaller and smaller sliver of the ever growing poor unrelatable characters. 

The low point of the novels was the end of the fourth book _A Feast for Crows_ where the author breaks the third wall to explain that stories for half the characters were absent because they were in _A Dance with Dragons_. To me the authors need to break the third wall helps to further highlight the fact these could have been a single 400 page book instead of four thousand page novels.
