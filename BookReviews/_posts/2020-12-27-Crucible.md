## A somewhat strange, but entertaining, end to the Star Wars Extended Universe timeline - 5/10

## Summary
This book continues the tie between the Extended Universe and the Mortis concept from the Clone Wars TV Show. I have never seen the TV show but have heard some about it in previous books I have read. I am never a huge fan of the prequel tie ins and this was no different. From a literary standpoint I think this book was very well written and I think it stands out as the best example of Troy Dennings writing chops in the Start WArs Universe. MY main issue with the book (which I will not spoil) is the ending. It this book wasn't more or less wrapping the entire EU, of which I have probably read 100+ books I would have rated it much high but I just didn't find the conclusion very satisfying. I feel like *The Unifying Force* by Luceno would have been a much better book to end the EU on.
