# 7.5/10 as an adult, 10/10 as a child

As a child, I really like Hitchhikers Guid to the Galaxy. I recently reread the first four books and found them not living up to my past expectations. The books are humorous but much of the books stems from the absurdity of the situations, this is alright in first book but as the books progress the levels of absurdity appear to be cranked up further and further until you reach *So Long and Thanks for All the Fish* which was a little painful to read. 

I will note, I read all these books back to back (I had a collection of all four in one volume). It is very possible the my growing tied of the style of humor caused my distaste for the later books so perhaps the books are great with a break/rest taken between reads. 

Generally, I would recommend reading the first book, especially if one liked it as a child, but would definitely not recommend reading the entire *Complete* Hitchhikers Guide in one go.
