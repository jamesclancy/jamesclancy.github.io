## Easy to read but very outdated. Perhaps a newer edition would be better - 6/10

The book explains communication as a cycle of message and response which happens inside the context of a culture. I can actually see the techniques discussed in the book utilized in the  prose of the book and they do work. The book was well structured, easy to read and to skim and to understand. I feel like I was able to get a good amount of reminders about proper business writing from the book but unfortunately much of the information in the book is outdated (the book is from 2012). I assume there is a more recent version of the book (I picked this up for free at a book give-a-way) but many of the concepts and details discussed in the book don't really apply in a work of Teams, Confluence, Slack and Zoom.

While the core concepts of communicator and audience strategy still apply I feel that much of the meat of the book focused on the details of message, channel and cultural strategies which I think have all changed substantially over the last decade. This was a decent refresher course on professional writing and the book was the right price (free) but I would certainly opt for a newer edition if a reader is planning on actually purchasing a copy.
