## An interesting and easy read that while slanted is great - 8/10

_Empire of the Summer Moon_ is definitely a history book written with to fit the authors narrative. The book describes the late history of the Comanche people and there nineteenth century conflicts with the US government. The book is very interesting, the stories and history is exciting and well written in an approachable way creating an easy read regardless of your interest in the actual subject matter. 

The reason I am giving the book a 8/10 is because it does appear to trying to sell a very specific narrative. The books seems to take the view of particular characters being great heros of the west and seems to try to really force those ideas. Not only does the book build up the heros but it also portrays and emphasizes the flaws in the characters around them. While I enjoyed the book I was expecting it to take a more academic view of history and focus more on facts less on selling a viewpoint.
