## Weaker than Shards of Alderaan but still readable - 6.5/10

As another free _Young Jedi Knights_ book I found I read this after finishing _Shards of Alderaan_. This was definitely weaker than _Shard of Alderaan_ but still a very readable book and a very easy read at that. This book focused much more on combat but seemed to sort fo glance over any sort fo details or violence. This makes sense as it seems to be geared towards a younger audience it did make the book significantly less interesting. The book only took a few hours to read though so I would still recommend the investment to any fans of the _Nee Jedi Order_ series.
