## Meh. Lacking in both technical detail and amusing stories - 5/10

## Summary

The book discusses the evolution of how people view geometry and the world around them in general from ancient greeks discovering axiomatic thought to modern string theory. The book largely focuses on the history but does give general overviews of the technological developments.

## My Impressions

This book only briefly touches on technical subjects and largely focuses on the history. In telling the history there are some comical moments but general is quite bland. Interest could have been generated by more thoroughly digging into the technical side or focusing more on page turning amusing prose. Unfortunately, the book left me feeling it was just `meh`. It was readable but not a page turner, this really disappointed me as the subject matter is so interesting.
