## Boring string of brief histories 5/10

_The Arabs - A History_ by Eugene Rogan was similar in goal but significantly worse executed than _The Fortunes of Africa - A 5000-Year History of Wealth, Greed, and Endeavor _. The Book didn't go in to much detail which makes a good amount of sense due to the breadth it was trying to cover but didn't really dive into anything deep enough to inspire further research or interest. The book started during the ottoman rule of the Middle East and Northern Africa and quickly transitioned into a discussion of recent European interests in the region and onto the current political system.

Perhaps _The Fortunes of Africa_ was just such an outstanding book that it makes this one seems unfairly bad but I cannot help but think I learned more and gained more knowledge about the Middle East region reading that book then this focused book. I would not recommend bothering to read this and perhaps looking for a different book on the topic.
