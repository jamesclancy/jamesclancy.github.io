## This is a very well written concise but detailed book on the inner workings of microprocessors and assembly - 9/10

Going into the book I was expecting some choice comically outdated computing knowledge from the the 1970s. Overall, I was extremely impressed by how well the book as held up and feel like that is a side effect of just how superb the book is. The book was easy to read and follow, seems approachable to all audiences and covers a good amount of basic topics. While teh discussions about selecting different types of 4-bit vs 8bit microprocessors are dated the points they bring up and thought process the book documents is still valid today and of value to anyone with an interest in technology and computing. 

I would highly recommend this book to anyone interesting in learning or brushing up on the inner working of microprocessors.
