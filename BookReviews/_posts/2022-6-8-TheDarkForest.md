## More intriguing but less interesting - 6.5/10

## Summary

The follow up to _The Three Body Problem_ and the second book in the the _Remembrance of Earth's Past_ trilogy, it follows the events on Earth as copes with the knowledge of incoming hostile aliens and attempts to prepare itself.

## My Impressions

I found the ideas of how Earth would cope in such a situation insightful and intriguing. The book holds a powerful mirror up to society, humanity and potentially life in general. Unfortunately I didn't think the book was very exciting or much of an interesting read. I felt many of stories to be overly long and more detailed then needed without enough excitement or development to make it particularly engaging.

Overall, I find it a valuable study on human psychology but not a great piece of science fiction.
