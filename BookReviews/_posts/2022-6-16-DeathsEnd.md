## An amazing conclusion to the series. - 8.5/10

## Summary

The final book in the the _Remembrance of Earth's Past_ trilogy, it follows the timeline of the universe during and after Earth's Cold War with the Trisolarans.

## My Impressions

This title continued the series' interesting philosophical discord but framed it a way which made it more directly related to our current world. Unlike the previous books, this title honed in on the most important characters an delivered a page turning, exciting book.

I feel that _Death's End_ is a good enough book to justify reading the other books in the trilogy and I would recommend anyone read the the series.
