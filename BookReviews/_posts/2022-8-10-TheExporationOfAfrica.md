##  Very generic, you should just read the Wikipedia article - 5/10

_The Exploration of Africa_ is history book I picked up at the Book Thing. I am assuming it is meant for school libraries or something along those lines. It wasn't particularly bad but not very interesting. If you need a physical book you can cite for a high school history report this may be for you but otherwise I would just read the Wikipedia page on the exploration of Africa.
