## Mildly amusing but not that amusing - 7/10

Redshirts tells the story of science fiction characters who have discovered their high fatality rate is do to them being characters on a Sci-Fi TV show. These character then embark on a journey to increase there life spans and engage of various antics.

Overall, the book was okay and brought up a variety of interesting philosophical topics but was not a page turner and only moderately entertaining.
