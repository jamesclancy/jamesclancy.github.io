## Easy to read book with a decent overview of general management theory  - 7/10


## Summary

The book tells the story of a mysterious stranger who meets Winnie the Pooh in the forest to discuss how management techniques are demonstrated in Pooh's adventures and how these techniques may have improved their associated outcomes. 

## My Impressions

Overall the book isn't really for me but was an easy and quick read. It clearly outlines the responsibilities of a manager i.e.:

1. Establish Objectives
2. Organizing
3. Motivating
4. Developing
5. Analysis

and things like `SMART` Goals. 

Overall, I think this would be a great token gift for a new manager or similar but probably is more of a token gift book vs a book someone should actually seek out and read on their own.
