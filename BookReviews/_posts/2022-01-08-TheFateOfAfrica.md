## Excellent fast past history giving a brief overviews of a broad range of topics 8.5/10

_The Fortunes of Africa - A 5000-Year History of Wealth, Greed, and Endeavor _ really didn't go into to many details but I think it worked in this format. The book gave an overview of five thousand years of history across an entire continent so it necessarily  didn't go into great detail. Rather then thinking of this book as a "history" book I think of this book as a "Cliff Notes" on topics and an invitation for further research. I felt the book was inviting, expected little previous knowledge and well paced. 

I would recommend this to someone who has a broad interest in world history but is looking for new topics to really dive into. I would not recommend this book to those who already possesses great knowledge of the African history or are looking to learning about any particular time period or region as this is not a detailed history.
