## A great and interesting read which rivals but doesn't quite match The Fortunes of Africa 8/10

_The Fate of Africa -  A History of the Continent Since Independence_ comes from the same author as _The Fortunes of Africa - A 5000-Year History of Wealth, Greed, and Endeavor _ and similarly tries to outline the general flow of history across the diverse and independent regions of Africa while respecting that it is a definitive guide on no particular items. _The Fate of Africa_ focuses in on the history of Africa since the beginning of decolonization after WWII. The book does a great job of attempting to briefly summarize significant events and how they fit together an within the entire geopolitical trends of the time. 

Coming from the same author as _Fortunes_, Martin Meredith, I had high expectations for the novel and I was not disappointed. The book imbraced the limitation of being a single 700 page volume and treated the subject matter with respect attempting not to focus to much on particularities but rather provide the user with ideas for independent research. I do think book was less of a page turner then _Fortunes_ but would still highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest but not a strong background in the recent history of Africa or the Cold War in general.
