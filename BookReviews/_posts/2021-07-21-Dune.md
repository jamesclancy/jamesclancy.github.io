## A classic, but slow to start - 8.5/10

I have tried to read *Dune* in the past and have never been able to get past the first couple chapters. 
I finally pushed through the start and made it through the book. Overall, the book is a classic. It tells an 
interesting story which can both be viewed on its own or tied to and related to the world around us. 

From a literary standpoint the book starts a little slow. One of the annoying parts of the book is that some of the 
characters have *sci-fi* names while some have normal English names. Upon research this might have some sort of symbolic value but
it does really make the names a little difficult to remember and makes it harder to follow the plot in the beginning. 

*Dune* is one of those sci-fi books that you can really dig into and think about and not a simple read like *The Hitchhikers Guide* for example. I would recommend that any science fiction fans stomach the first hundred pages and read *Dune*, I definitely enjoyed teh book and will probably read some of the sequels.
