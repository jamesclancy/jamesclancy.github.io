## Actually pretty good and entertaining 8/10

_Congo_ is a novel about a diamonds companies expedition to investigate a scouting team which went missing in the jungles of the Congo. The book features is the "techno-thriller" which is written like it was based on real events and is from the same author as Jurassic Park.

There was a film made based on this book and it was supposedly quite bad, it won a number of Golden Raspberry Awards. I decided to read the book despite the films reputation as I like _Jurassic Park_. I was pleasantly surprised by the book, it was a great, exciting story and while a little far fetched did seem to be well researched and a  good amount of effort spent to make it "realistic".
