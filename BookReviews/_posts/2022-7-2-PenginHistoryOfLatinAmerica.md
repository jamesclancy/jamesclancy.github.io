## Cool cover. Weak book. - 5.5/10

_The Penguin History of Latin America_ attempts to detail the history of South and Central America from the times of Columbus till today. Unfortunately, this book falls in the familiar pattern of attempting to cover to much and degrading into a series of brief summaries of time periods listed after each other. While the book does cover many things, it never draws the reader in with much interesting content and lacks in any sort of cohesion to ties the historical events together.

The book would probably be alright for someone wanted a brief refresher on the history for someone already familiar but not a great general interest piece.
