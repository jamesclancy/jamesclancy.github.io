## An excellent book everyone should read. - 9/10

## Summary

The book follows the lives of a family intertwined in the drug trade in the Franklin Square neighborhood of Baltimore.

## My Impressions

This is an excellent book which I would recommend for everyone. The book is written as a novel but based on journalist interviews over the course of a year. This creates a intriguing and compelling narrative while still allowing following real life events. I really likes this general format, it actually reminded me a lot of _Beautiful Swimmers_ in that way and I definitely need to explore more books written in a similar format. 

The material of the book provides a realistic view into the world of addiction and the deeply systemized issues associated with it. The book should be mandatory reading for anyone who lacks empathy or is overly trusting of others trapped in the spiral of addiction.
