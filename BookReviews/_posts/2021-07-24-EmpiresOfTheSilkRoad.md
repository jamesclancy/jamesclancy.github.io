## An interesting but seemingly skewed view of history - 7/10

## Summary

The book details the history of the "Central Eurasian" cultures throughout history. Instead of following any one particular group of people it focuses on cultures which at the time satisfied the authors defined characteristics of "Central Eurasian" culture. This fluid definition of the included cultures does create an interesting perspective to view history. The book gives some interesting perspectives on how the economic systems of nomadic controlled areas work and the importance of free trade. It also discussed how this was eventually over powered by the Western naval trade. 

Overall, I thought the book offered some very interesting perspectives and presented the silk road in a new way. Unfortunately, I found much of the views express to skew towards the "Central Eurasian" cultures being the perfect good guys. They were merely peace-loving people who just wanted free trade. While many of the central eurasian cultures have been represented unfairly in past historical literature this seems to be a bit of an over correction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the history of Central Asia or historic economies but its skew has to be understood.
