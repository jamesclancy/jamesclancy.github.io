## Moderately interesting but not all that informative 5/10

_The Boxer Rebellion_ tells the story of foreigners and christian converts trapped in the Beijing (Peking) Legations and cathedrals as they waited to be saved from the populist "boxers".

Over all the book attempted to give a more human look and perspective to those trapped under the blockade and make the story more human and relatable. Overall though I found the book to provide little information or history that I did not learn in high school history class. The Boxer Rebellion was a very significant historical event as it marked beginning of the end of imperial china and colonialism in china but this books did little to explore the implications, meanings, motivations or effects of the rebellion. Instead of focusing on significant impacts or novel facts the book largely seemed to focus on how the people eat horses and rationed rice which while interesting to hear is not all that significant.
