## An intriguing idea and building to something but not to exciting on its own - 7/10

## Summary

A general sci-fi novel kicking off the _Remembrance of Earth's Past_ trilogy, it follows several physicists related to a conspiracy revolving around extraterrestrial life. 

## My Impressions

I found the story and the conspiracy to be a novel and interesting concept and I feel like the book did a great job of setting up the trilogy but the book wasn't really a page turner. While the book was certainly readable and entertaining the book doesn't really stand on its own. I will probably read the subsequent books in the series but the first book definitely was not meant to be an entire story and I would only recommend the book if you are prepared to read the subsequent books. Additionally, some of the prose quality was lost in translation. While the translation was well done some of the flow was a somewhat "chunky", rough and doesn't necessarily translate very well but I translator does address that this was intentional at the end of the book.
