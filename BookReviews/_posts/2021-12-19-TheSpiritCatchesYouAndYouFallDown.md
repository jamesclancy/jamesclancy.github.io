## Interesting view on culture clashes and the medical system - 7/10

_The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down_ is an true story telling the story of a family of refugees coming to America and having a variety of encounters with the American Medical System. The book paints a picture of family trying to do the best they can as best they know it and the troubled attempts of the medical sy8stem to reach and help the family.

The book doesn't portray the family or the doctors working with them in a bad light but rather highlights the inability of the system they exist in to best facilitate communication and the successful distribution of healthcare where it is needed.

I liked that the book didn't focus on blaming people but rather highlighted how everyone was doing the best they could in the systems they existed in and the systems let everyone down. While not a particularly exciting I think the book is an excellent tale to emphasis the importance of empathy and trying to meet people where they are.
