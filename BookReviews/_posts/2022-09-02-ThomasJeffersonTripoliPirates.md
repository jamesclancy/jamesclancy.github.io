## Easy read about little discussed historical events 7.5/10

Early in America's history the nation had no navy and no way to protect US flagged merchants. _Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates_ tells the story of how America's policy for dealing with pirates shifted from capitulation and ransoms to war.

I thought the book did a great job of explaining the dire and weak position America found itself in immediately after independency. The story is an easy read and provides a good frame of reference to look at the US's journey from a fledgling country to a superpower.
