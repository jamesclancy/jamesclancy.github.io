## Not great for the genre - 4/10

_The Armies of the Night_ is one of the earliest works of "gonzo" journalism. The book follows the author's participation in the March on the Pentagon protesting the Vietnam War. The title discusses the wide range of views in the 1960s US's counterculture left and its growing disparities.

Largely, I found the book to be boring and the author to be quite pretensions. I believe that was possibly the point, as a way to highlight the disparities in the protest but I believe it made the book largely unreadable and quite difficult to get through. I would say this book is ver weak compared to the works of Wolfe or Thompson and do not recommend.
