## Pretentious and not all that funny 6/10

_A Confederacy of Dunces_ tells the story of an over educated and unemployable man who has to venture out from his mother's house to get a job after his alcoholic mother gets into a car crash.

Overall, the book reminded me of a 1960's version of the 2012 film, (The Comedy)[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_comedy]. The main character was generally just unlikeable and unpleasant and not interesting. If the character had been more over the top of antagonistic he might have been likable but overall he just came off as immature.
