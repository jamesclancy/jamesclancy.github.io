## An easy and moderately informative read - 7.5/10

## Summary

Guns, Germs and Steel is probably the most famous recent history book in pop culture-- it is very easy to see why. The book is a very easy read and extremely approachable for anyone. The book doesn't touch any particularly controversial issues and generally assumes the read has no background knowledge (i.e. no need to look things up on Wikipedia).

While I found the book a nice read and enjoyable I am giving it a 7.5 due to its lack of detail. I really would have liked to hear more details on how the Han culture spread spread China or more history on the spread of Bantu people across Sub-Saharian Africa. I understand he was just using them as examples to highlight the power of food production, population adn technology but I would have enjoyed spending some more time in the weeds. Overall, I feel like this book has given me a greater sense of curiosity about certain aspects of history and has inspired me to research more.
