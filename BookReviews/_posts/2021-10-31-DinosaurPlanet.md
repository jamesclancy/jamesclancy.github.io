## A Story about Veterinarians Working for an Interplanetary Strip Mining Company? - 1.5/10

The general plot follows "xenobiologists" who work for an "energy extraction" company who find themselves stuck on a strange world populated by dinosaurs. This seemed like such a ridiculous plot that I figured this would be an interesting read. This assumption proved to be incorrect. This book was very slow to start, hard to read and has not aged well.

One aging issue is that the heros of the book at strip miners who are searching for energy sources? While they casually discuss destroying the planet and such they preachily discuss the merits of vegetarianism etc. Clearly, in the 1970s when the book was written the energy extraction industry was viewed in a much more positive more `forward` light. 

Additionally, the book attempts to be `adult` in very forced ways. A number of `mature` topics are forced into dialog throughout the novel in a way which suggests an immaturity of the author or expected audience. This is a common problem I have seen in a number of older sci-fi books that are clearly attempting to appear to both an adult and young adult audience. From a life lesson standpoint, this really highlight the value and necessity of targeting specific audiences and personas.

This is definitely not a book I would recommend but it does appear to have good Amazon reviews so perhaps I am just not the correct audience.
