## Could be the start of an interesting series but not great by itself 7.5/10

_A Game of Thrones_ sets up a fantasy world set in the middle ages setting of knights, dragons and other fantasy cliches. I have heard a lot about the TV show so I figured I would give teh books a read. The first novel follows a cast of characters as they navigate palace intrigue eventually leading the death of a King and sets up an environment for more novel to explore teh kings succession.

As with many fantasy books the novel was written in an overly flowery style which made it needlessly long and stretched out. Overall teh book was okay but definitely not a complete story. While the book wasn't exactly gripping it did hold my interest and I will continue to read the other books. Generally, this was really just an introduction to this fantasy universe and not a book which could stand on its own two feet. Only reading the subsequent books will tell if the time investment in reading this was worthwhile.
