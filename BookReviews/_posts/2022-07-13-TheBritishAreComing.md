## Informative and sometimes engaging 6.5/10

_The British Are Coming_ is a detailed recount of the early parts of the American Revolution. It begins at the lead up to the conflict and coves till just after the crossing of the Delaware. The book did cover a variety of the conflicts in detail and gave a good amount of  background information on the several interesting military characters such as Admiral Howe. I did find the book well written and sporadically interesting. Unfortunately I feel like the book went a little too far into the weeds for me and lost my interest. If you are extremely interested in the revolutionary war this may be the book for you but I would not consider it a "pop-history" book for general consumption.
