## Definitely geared towards kids but not bad - 7.5/10

I thought maybe I had read these as a kid but after starting to read some of the _Young Jedi Knights_ books I don't think I read these as a kid. Overall the book was simple and a really fast read. The book is clearly for kids which definitely shows in teh language, topics and writing style but the book was extremely quick to read. 

Previous Kevin Anderson Start Wars books I have read have been less than stellar so wasn't expecting much but this book was pretty solid. I would recommend this book to anyone who read and enjoyed the New Jedi Order. While this book isn't exactly great literature it does provide some valuable insights into the back stories of the _NJO_ characters.
