## Short and focused and moderately informative 7.5/10

_The Laws of Simplicity_ outlines a number of "laws" for creating elegant solutions which seem simple. The book features 10 laws which generally lead to the final law which is remove the obvious and add meaning. I found the book a very simple read and relatively informative and. My overall impression after reading was that there is only one law of simplicity but I found going through a ll the various laws helpful to lead the reader to that conclusion. 

The book only took a few hours to read and for that amount of time I think it was worthwhile but I probably would be annoyed if I actually spent money on the book and didn't get it for free.
