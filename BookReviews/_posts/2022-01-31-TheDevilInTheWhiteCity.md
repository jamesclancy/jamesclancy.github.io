## More true crime than popular history 6/10

_The Devil in the White City_ follows two simultaneous story lines taking place in the late 1800s in Chicago. One story line follows the design and construction of the 1893 Columbian Exposition, the other follows a serial killer who is active in Chicago at the same time. The book mixes true crime with history to form a somewhat connected story that serves to portray the depravity of Chicago at the time. 
I was expecting a little more history and am not a large fan of the _true crime_ genre but the book was certainly readable and relatively entertaining. I do think the composition of the multiple story lines did help to highlight the social issues of the time but I was honestly much more interested in the raising of the fair then the exploits of Holmes (the serial killer). I think this is good book if you are looking for true crime but probably not recommend it as a popular history.
