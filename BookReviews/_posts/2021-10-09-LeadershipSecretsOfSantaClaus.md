## Definitely a waste of time to read - 2/10

Inspired by how I liked _Make It So_ I decided to read more "pop" business books. I picked this up for free and it was not worth the price. The book could have been an article or something along those lines but was extended with fluff to fill out one hundred pages. I am assuming this was written to be given out at leadership workshops or something and is not meant to be taken as a serious book.
