I am a software developer in the Mid-Atlantic. This site is quite a mess at the moment. I am using it as a means to generate content. At some point I may come back and clean it up.

Largely, I am writing this as a way to start documenting the weird food combinations I am eating to get rid of the various stock pilled foods I have left over from the pandemic.
